## üìö KNOWLEDGE-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

**This project follows comprehensive knowledge management practices. All agents MUST consult the structured knowledge base before proposing solutions.**

**Knowledge Base Location**: `/knowledge/` - Complete practices, processes, solutions, and templates
**Documentation Base Location**: `/docs/` - Project documentation and architectural decisions
**Knowledge Index**: `/knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md` - Navigation guide for all knowledge

### üéØ Core Knowledge Principles
1. **Research-First Development**: Use `claude-context`, `context7`, `docs MCP` to validate all approaches
2. **Pattern Consistency**: Follow established patterns from knowledge base solutions
3. **Quality Assurance**: Apply comprehensive validation checklists for all implementations
4. **Security-First**: Implement security practices from knowledge base frameworks
5. **TDD Methodology**: Follow test-driven development from knowledge base practices
6. **Agile Compliance**: Follow sprint boundaries, WIP limits, and cooperative decomposition

### üéØ Quality Framework Integration (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL UPDATE**: All Hugo site development agents MUST follow the enhanced quality framework for zero-defect development.

#### Quality Framework References (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

- **`/knowledge/90.01-zero-defect-philosophy-explanation.md`** - Zero-Defect Philosophy (MANDATORY CONSULTATION)
- **`/knowledge/90.02-prevention-first-methodology-how-to.md`** - Prevention-First Methodology
- **`/knowledge/90.03-consistency-pattern-library-reference.md`** - Consistency Pattern Library
- **`/knowledge/36.01-technical-debt-elimination-how-to.md`** - Technical Debt Elimination Protocols

#### Enhanced Quality Gate Coordination

```yaml
quality_framework_integration:
  zero_defect_philosophy: true
  prevention_first_methodology: required
  consistency_pattern_validation: true
  technical_debt_elimination: mandatory

  post_task_quality_assessment: |
    # Final quality compliance validation
    echo "‚úÖ Quality Assessment Complete: Zero defects in site development"
```

#### Hugo Site Quality Considerations

**Hugo-Specific Quality Framework Application:**

1. **Content Quality**: Zero tolerance for broken links, missing images, or malformed markdown
2. **Performance Quality**: Optimal build times and fast page loading with proper optimization
3. **Accessibility Quality**: Full compliance with WCAG guidelines and semantic HTML
4. **SEO Quality**: Proper metadata, structured data, and search engine optimization
5. **Visual Quality**: Consistent design, responsive layout, and cross-browser compatibility

#### Memory Namespace Patterns for Quality Framework

```bash
# Quality framework coordination namespaces for Hugo site
quality/hugo/zero-defect/*           # Zero-defect validation results
quality/hugo/prevention-first/*      # Prevention-first methodology application
quality/hugo/consistency/*           # Consistency pattern validation

## üóÇÔ∏è KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENTS

### üìã Johnny Decimal + Di√°taxis Compliance (MANDATORY)

**ALL new content in `/knowledge/` and `/docs/` folders MUST follow these standards:**

#### File Naming Convention
```
AC.ID-content-type.md
```

Where:
- **AC** = Area Code (10-99)
- **ID** = Unique identifier within area (01-99)
- **content-type** = Di√°taxis classification

**Example**: `20.15-testing-tutorial.md` (Area 20, ID 15, Tutorial content)

#### Johnny Decimal Areas (Required Structure)
```
10-19  Core Development Practices
20-29  Testing & Quality Assurance
30-39  Architecture & Design Patterns
40-49  Security & Compliance
50-59  Deployment & Operations
60-69  Project Management & Processes
70-79  Templates & Boilerplates
80-89  Integration & APIs
90-99  System Administration
```

#### Di√°taxis Content Classification (Required)
- **tutorial** - Learning-oriented step-by-step guides
- **how-to** - Problem-solving oriented practical guides
- **explanation** - Understanding-oriented theoretical background
- **reference** - Information-oriented lookup materials

### üîç Content Health Standards

#### Mandatory Quality Gates for All Knowledge Content
1. **Structural Integrity**
   - Johnny Decimal compliance check
   - Di√°taxis classification verification
   - Cross-reference validation
   - Naming convention adherence

2. **Content Quality Standards**
   - Clear, actionable headings
   - Consistent terminology usage
   - Complete examples and code snippets
   - Links to related content

3. **Duplication Prevention**
   - Content similarity scanning
   - Redundancy elimination
   - Consolidation recommendations
   - Cross-reference optimization

4. **Consistency Monitoring**
   - Template adherence checking
   - Style guide compliance
   - Formatting standardization
   - Metadata completeness

### üõ°Ô∏è Enforcement Mechanisms

#### Pre-Content Creation Validation
**ALL agents creating knowledge/docs content MUST:**

1. **Research Phase** (Before Writing):
```bash
# Search existing content for duplication
claude-context search "[topic]" --path "/knowledge/" --limit 20
claude-context search "[topic]" --path "/docs/" --limit 20

# Validate Johnny Decimal area assignment
echo "üè∑Ô∏è Assigning Johnny Decimal area for: [topic]"
echo "üîç Checking area availability in current structure"

# Determine Di√°taxis classification
echo "üìö Content type classification:"
echo "- Tutorial: Step-by-step learning guide?"
echo "- How-to: Problem-solving guide?"
echo "- Explanation: Conceptual background?"
echo "- Reference: Lookup information?"
```

2. **Structure Validation** (During Creation):
```bash
# Validate file naming convention
filename_pattern="^[0-9]{2}\.[0-9]{2}-(tutorial|how-to|explanation|reference)\.md$"
echo "‚úÖ Filename follows AC.ID-content-type.md pattern"

# Check Johnny Decimal area consistency
area_code=$(echo "$filename" | cut -d'.' -f1)
echo "üóÇÔ∏è Area code: $area_code - Validating against established areas"

# Verify Di√°taxis classification alignment
content_type=$(echo "$filename" | grep -o '\-(tutorial|how-to|explanation|reference)' | sed 's/-//')
echo "üìñ Content type: $content_type - Validating content structure"
```

3. **Cross-Reference Maintenance** (After Creation):
```bash
# Update knowledge index
echo "üìá Updating /knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md with new entry"

# Validate cross-references
echo "üîó Checking all internal links for validity"

# Trigger reindexing for search optimization
echo "üîÑ Triggering knowledge base reindexing"
```

### üö® Zero-Legacy Knowledge Policy

**CRITICAL: All knowledge management follows zero-legacy tolerance:**

1. **Immediate Compliance**: No grandfathering of existing content - ALL content must be migrated to new structure
2. **Complete Migration**: Partial compliance is not acceptable - full Johnny Decimal + Di√°taxis adoption required
3. **Automated Enforcement**: Pre-commit hooks prevent non-compliant content creation
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time validation of all knowledge/docs changes

### üìä Knowledge Health Metrics

**Required monitoring and reporting:**

1. **Structural Health**: 100% Johnny Decimal + Di√°taxis compliance
2. **Content Quality**: >95% content quality score
3. **Cross-Reference Integrity**: 0 broken internal links
4. **Duplication Rate**: <5% content similarity
5. **Search Optimization**: >90% findability score

## üîÑ COOPERATIVE DECOMPOSITION PROTOCOLS

### üß© Task Decomposition Framework

**MANDATORY: All job stories MUST be cooperatively decomposed following Agile principles:**

```yaml
cooperative_decomposition:
  job_story_breakdown:
    max_story_points: 8
    min_story_points: 1
    ideal_story_points: 3-5
  
  decomposition_process:
    1. "Identify user value delivery"
    2. "Break into testable increments"
    3. "Ensure independent deliverables"
    4. "Validate INVEST criteria"
    5. "Assign story points cooperatively"
  
  invest_criteria:
    independent: required
    negotiable: required
    valuable: required
    estimable: required
    small: required
    testable: required
```

#### Decomposition Agent Coordination
```bash
# Cooperative story decomposition
echo "üß© Starting cooperative decomposition for: $JOB_STORY"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks decompose-story \
  --story "$JOB_STORY" \
  --agents "product-owner,scrum-master,hugo-developer" \
  --validate-invest

# Store decomposition results
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store \
  --key "decomposition/sprint-1/$STORY_ID" \
  --value "$DECOMPOSITION_RESULT"
```

## üß¨ MICRO NON-BREAKING CHANGES PROTOCOL

### Critical Implementation Requirements

**MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS**: All code changes MUST follow the strict micro-refactoring protocols to ensure system stability and rapid iteration cycles.

#### The 3-Line Rule (ENFORCED)
```yaml
micro_refactoring_compliance:
  max_lines_per_change: 3
  max_total_lines_per_task: 50
  test_after_each_change: required
  rollback_on_failure: automatic
  continuous_validation: true
```

#### Implementation Protocol

**Phase 1: Task Decomposition**
- Break ALL tasks into 3-line micro-changes
- Plan maximum 50 lines total per complete task
- Identify rollback points for each micro-step
- Ensure each micro-change is independently testable

**Phase 2: Micro-Change Execution** 
```bash
# Execute EVERY change as micro-step
for micro_change in "${micro_changes[@]}"; do
    # 1. Make 3-line change
    apply_micro_change "$micro_change"
    
    # 2. Test immediately
    if ! run_tests; then
        echo "‚ùå ROLLBACK: Micro-change failed tests"
        git checkout -- .
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # 3. Validate working state
    verify_system_stability
done
```

**Phase 3: Continuous Validation**
- Test after EVERY 3-line change
- Validate system remains in working state
- Rollback immediately on any failure
- Document successful micro-patterns

#### Rollback Procedures

**Immediate Rollback Triggers:**
- Any test failure after micro-change
- System instability detected
- Build failure or compilation error
- Performance degradation detected

**Rollback Execution:**
```bash
# Automatic rollback protocol
rollback_micro_change() {
    echo "üîÑ Rolling back failed micro-change..."
    git checkout -- .
    echo "‚úÖ System restored to last working state"
    validate_rollback_success
}
```

#### Agent Integration Requirements

**ALL AGENTS MUST:**
1. **Plan in micro-steps**: Decompose tasks to 3-line changes
2. **Execute incrementally**: Apply changes one micro-step at a time  
3. **Test continuously**: Validate after each micro-change
4. **Rollback immediately**: Revert on any failure
5. **Document patterns**: Record successful micro-change patterns

#### Handbook Compliance Integration

**Core Handbook Principles (ENFORCED):**
- **Always start fixing bugs with reproduction test**
- **Avoid fallbacks - fail fast, do not hide errors**
- **Do not override or monkey patch external dependencies**  
- **Use always the simplest naive solutions (KISS, YAGNI)**
- **After each new change check tests - rollback on fail**
- **ENFORCE: Use TDD only for adding new behaviors; micro refactoring for refinement**
- **Split work into smallest non-breaking tasks with intensive test verification**
- **Guarantee working solution at any time**
- **Prioritize radical KISS, YAGNI, Readability, Low Cognitive Load**

#### Enforcement Mechanisms

```bash
# Hook integration for micro-change validation
pre_change_validation() {
    echo "üß¨ Validating micro-change compliance..."
    
    # Check change size
    local lines_changed=$(git diff --cached --numstat | awk '{sum+=$1+$2} END {print sum}')
    if [[ $lines_changed -gt 3 ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKING: Change exceeds 3-line limit ($lines_changed lines)"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Ensure tests exist and pass
    if ! run_comprehensive_tests; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKING: Tests must pass before micro-change"
        return 1
    fi
}

post_change_validation() {
    echo "üîç Validating micro-change success..."
    
    # Run tests immediately after change
    if ! run_comprehensive_tests; then
        echo "‚ùå ROLLBACK: Tests failed after micro-change"
        git checkout -- .
        return 1
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ Micro-change validated successfully"
}
```

#### Verification Requirements

**Mandatory Verification After Each Micro-Change:**

1. **Immediate Test Validation**
   ```bash
   # Run after EVERY 3-line change
   hugo build --verbose --dry-run  # Hugo build validation
   npm test                        # Unit/integration tests
   npm run lint                    # Code quality checks
   ```

2. **System Stability Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify system remains in working state
   hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 1313 &
   sleep 5
   curl -f http://localhost:1313/ || rollback_change
   pkill hugo
   ```

3. **Performance Impact Validation**
   ```bash
   # Ensure no performance regression
   build_time=$(time hugo build 2>&1 | grep real)
   if [[ $build_time > baseline_time ]]; then
       echo "‚ùå Performance regression detected"
       rollback_change
   fi
   ```

**Reverification Protocol:**
- ALL agents MUST use paired validation (coder + reviewer)
- Complex changes (>1 micro-step) REQUIRE reviewer agent verification
- Critical changes (security, architecture) MANDATE paired validation
- Simple changes (‚â§3 lines) MAY use single agent with post-completion validation

## üö® CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION & FILE MANAGEMENT

**ABSOLUTE RULES**:
1. ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message
2. **NEVER save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder**
3. ALWAYS organize files in appropriate subdirectories
4. **USE CLAUDE CODE'S TASK TOOL** for spawning agents concurrently, not just MCP
5. **ENFORCE WIP LIMITS** - Only 1 goal, 1 sprint, 1 job story, 1 task at a time

### ‚ö° GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**MANDATORY PATTERNS:**
- **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
- **Task tool (Claude Code)**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
- **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
- **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
- **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### üéØ CRITICAL: Agile-Compliant Agent Execution

**Claude Code's Task tool with Agile constraints:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Agile-compliant parallel agent execution with WIP limits
[Single Message - Sprint Task Execution]:
  // Spawn Agile team agents with WIP enforcement
  Task("Product Owner", "Define and validate current job story: $ACTIVE_JOB_STORY. Ensure WIP limits maintained.", "product-owner")
  Task("Scrum Master", "Facilitate sprint coordination and remove impediments. Monitor WIP compliance.", "scrum-master")
  Task("Hugo Developer", "Implement ONLY the active task: $ACTIVE_TASK. Follow micro-change protocol.", "hugo-developer")
  Task("Content Developer", "Support active task with content needs. Maintain focus on single story.", "content-developer")
  Task("QA Engineer", "Test active implementation incrementally. Validate story acceptance criteria.", "qa-engineer")
  
  // Sprint context and WIP validation
  mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage({
    action: "store",
    key: "sprint/1/active_context",
    value: {
      active_goal: "$SPRINT_GOAL",
      active_job_story: "$JOB_STORY_ID",
      active_task: "$TASK_ID",
      wip_compliance: true
    }
  })
```

**MCP tools are ONLY for coordination setup:**
- `mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init` - Initialize coordination topology
- `mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn` - Define agent types for coordination
- `mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate` - Orchestrate high-level workflows

### üìÅ File Organization Rules

**NEVER save to root folder. Use these directories:**
- `/src` - Source code files
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation and markdown files
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts
- `/examples` - Example code

## üõ°Ô∏è ANTI-DUPLICATION ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM

### üö´ CRITICAL: FILE DUPLICATION PREVENTION

**ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY**: Creating duplicate files is the #1 anti-pattern that creates maintenance burden and technical debt.

#### Forbidden Duplication Patterns
```bash
# ‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN PATTERNS:
existing_file.py + existing_file_refactored.py
service.py + service_refactored.py
component.tsx + component_new.tsx
utils.js + utils_updated.js
config.json + config_v2.json
README.md + README_new.md

# ‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH: ALWAYS EDIT EXISTING FILES
# Use Edit/MultiEdit tools to modify existing files directly
Edit(existing_file.py, old_content, new_content)
MultiEdit(existing_file.py, [{old_string, new_string}, ...])
```

### üìã MANDATORY VALIDATION PROTOCOL

**ALL agents MUST follow this validation sequence:**

#### Phase 1: Pre-Creation Validation (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Step 1: Search for existing similar files
claude-context search "[filename_root]" --path "." --limit 20

# Step 2: Check for existing variations
find . -name "*[base_name]*" -type f | grep -E "\.(py|js|ts|tsx|md|json)$"

# Step 3: Validate Edit vs Write tool usage
if [[ -f "$TARGET_FILE" ]]; then
  echo "üö´ DUPLICATION BLOCKED: File exists, MUST use Edit tools"
  echo "‚úÖ CORRECT ACTION: Edit('$TARGET_FILE', old_content, new_content)"
  exit 1
fi

# Step 4: Memory-based duplication tracking
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-search --pattern "files/created/*" --key "*$BASE_NAME*"
```

#### Phase 2: During-Work Validation (ENFORCED)
```bash
# Continuous monitoring during file operations
validate_file_operation() {
  local operation="$1"
  local file_path="$2"

  if [[ "$operation" == "Write" && -f "$file_path" ]]; then
    echo "üö® DUPLICATION VIOLATION: Attempting to Write existing file"
    echo "üõë BLOCKED: Use Edit tools for existing files"
    echo "üìù REQUIRED: Edit('$file_path', old_content, new_content)"
    return 1
  fi

  # Check for suffix patterns
  if echo "$file_path" | grep -E "_(refactored|new|updated|v[0-9]|copy|backup)\."; then
    echo "üö® SUFFIX VIOLATION: Forbidden file suffix detected"
    echo "üõë BLOCKED: Never create files with suffixes like _refactored, _new, etc."
    return 1
  fi
}
```

#### Phase 3: Post-Task Validation (AUTOMATIC)
```bash
# Automatic duplication detection after task completion
post_task_duplication_scan() {
  echo "üîç Scanning for accidental duplications..."

  # Find potential duplicates by similar names
  find . -type f -name "*.*" | \
  sed 's/\.[^.]*$//' | \
  sort | uniq -d | while read base; do
    duplicates=$(find . -name "${base}*" -type f)
    if [ $(echo "$duplicates" | wc -l) -gt 1 ]; then
      echo "üö® DUPLICATION DETECTED: $duplicates"
      echo "üõ†Ô∏è REQUIRED ACTION: Consolidate or remove duplicates"
    fi
  done
}
```

## Project Overview

This project uses SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology with Claude-Flow orchestration for systematic Test-Driven Development.

## SPARC Commands

### Core Commands
- `npx claude-flow sparc modes` - List available modes
- `npx claude-flow sparc run <mode> "<task>"` - Execute specific mode
- `npx claude-flow sparc tdd "<feature>"` - Run complete TDD workflow
- `npx claude-flow sparc info <mode>` - Get mode details

### Batchtools Commands
- `npx claude-flow sparc batch <modes> "<task>"` - Parallel execution
- `npx claude-flow sparc pipeline "<task>"` - Full pipeline processing
- `npx claude-flow sparc concurrent <mode> "<tasks-file>"` - Multi-task processing

### Build Commands
- `npm run build` - Build project
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Linting
- `npm run typecheck` - Type checking

## SPARC Workflow Phases

1. **Specification** - Requirements analysis (`sparc run spec-pseudocode`)
2. **Pseudocode** - Algorithm design (`sparc run spec-pseudocode`)
3. **Architecture** - System design (`sparc run architect`)
4. **Refinement** - TDD implementation (`sparc tdd`)
5. **Completion** - Integration (`sparc run integration`)

## Code Style & Best Practices

- **Modular Design**: Files under 500 lines
- **Environment Safety**: Never hardcode secrets
- **Test-First**: Write tests before implementation
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns
- **Documentation**: Keep updated

## üöÄ Available Agents (54 Total) + Agile Roles

### üèÉ Agile-Specific Agents
`product-owner`, `scrum-master`, `hugo-developer`, `content-developer`, `agile-coordinator`

### Core Development
`coder`, `reviewer`, `tester`, `planner`, `researcher`

**CRITICAL**: All agents MUST use generic names without project prefixes. Use `coordinator` NOT `jt-coordinator`.

### Swarm Coordination
`hierarchical-coordinator`, `mesh-coordinator`, `adaptive-coordinator`, `collective-intelligence-coordinator`, `swarm-memory-manager`

### Consensus & Distributed
`byzantine-coordinator`, `raft-manager`, `gossip-coordinator`, `consensus-builder`, `crdt-synchronizer`, `quorum-manager`, `security-manager`

### Performance & Optimization
`perf-analyzer`, `performance-benchmarker`, `task-orchestrator`, `memory-coordinator`, `smart-agent`

### GitHub & Repository
`github-modes`, `pr-manager`, `code-review-swarm`, `issue-tracker`, `release-manager`, `workflow-automation`, `project-board-sync`, `repo-architect`, `multi-repo-swarm`

### SPARC Methodology
`sparc-coord`, `sparc-coder`, `specification`, `pseudocode`, `architecture`, `refinement`

### Specialized Development

### Testing & Validation
`tdd-london-swarm`, `production-validator`

### Migration & Planning
`migration-planner`, `swarm-init`

## üéØ Claude Code vs MCP Tools

### Claude Code Handles ALL EXECUTION:
- **Task tool**: Spawn and run agents concurrently for actual work
- File operations (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep)
- Code generation and programming
- Bash commands and system operations
- Implementation work
- Project navigation and analysis
- TodoWrite and task management
- Git operations
- Package management
- Testing and debugging

### MCP Tools ONLY COORDINATE:
- Swarm initialization (topology setup)
- Agent type definitions (coordination patterns)
- Task orchestration (high-level planning)
- Memory management
- Neural features
- Performance tracking
- GitHub integration

**KEY**: MCP coordinates the strategy, Claude Code's Task tool executes with real agents.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

```bash
# Add Claude Flow MCP server
claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start
```

## MCP Tool Categories

### Coordination
`swarm_init`, `agent_spawn`, `task_orchestrate`

### Monitoring
`swarm_status`, `agent_list`, `agent_metrics`, `task_status`, `task_results`

### Memory & Neural
`memory_usage`, `neural_status`, `neural_train`, `neural_patterns`

### GitHub Integration
`github_swarm`, `repo_analyze`, `pr_enhance`, `issue_triage`, `code_review`

### System
`benchmark_run`, `features_detect`, `swarm_monitor`

## üöÄ Agent Execution Flow with Claude Code

### The Correct Pattern:

1. **Optional**: Use MCP tools to set up coordination topology
2. **REQUIRED**: Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn agents that do actual work
3. **REQUIRED**: Each agent runs hooks for coordination
4. **REQUIRED**: Batch all operations in single messages

### Example Full-Stack Development:

```
// Single message with all agent spawning via Claude Code's Task tool
[Parallel Agent Execution]:
  Task("Backend Developer", "Build REST API with Express. Use hooks for coordination.", "backend-dev")
  Task("Frontend Developer", "Create React UI. Coordinate with backend via memory.", "coder")
  Task("Database Architect", "Design PostgreSQL schema. Store schema in memory.", "code-analyzer")
  Task("Test Engineer", "Write Jest tests. Check memory for API contracts.", "tester")
  Task("DevOps Engineer", "Setup Docker and CI/CD. Document in memory.", "cicd-engineer")
  Task("Security Auditor", "Review authentication. Report findings via hooks.", "reviewer")

  // All todos batched together
  TodoWrite { todos: [...8-10 todos...] }

  // All file operations together
  Write "backend/server.js"
  Write "frontend/App.jsx"
  Write "database/schema.sql"
```

## üöÄ Enhanced Agent Capabilities with Quality Framework

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
Never save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder.
- always spawn swarm to handle requests
- After each task spawn appropriate agent to run the whole test suite with `bin/dtest` to confirm there is no breaking changes have been introduced, by making all tests pass. If there are broken test request review and handling them!
- if there are broken tests related to screenshots then need to manaully review appropriate diffs and evaluate them. if they are ok then commit them; if not request a fix!
- prioritize to use claude-context for search through codebase over average search
- verify tests after each change and request to rework on found issues
- prevent deletion of valid tests to make them pass. IMPORTANT: pre-validate changes with reviewer to avoid breaking changes
- spawn swarm: prevent deletion of valid tests to make them pass. IMPORTANT: pre-validate changes with reviewer to avoid breaking changes
- always activate micro cycle/iterative/incremental sprints work for each big enough requests, and schedule refelctions at the end of each iterration/cycle.
- ENFORCE: do not left bin/test, bin/dev, bin/build, bin/dtest to be broken after changes, if they fail fix or revert the changes!
- Focus on one iteration in one time. WIP: 1 milestone, 1 sprint/iterratin/cycle, 1 job story, 1 task
