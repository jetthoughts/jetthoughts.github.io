### 🔄 Enhanced TDD Cycle: Red-Shameless Green-Flocking Refactor

**Integration**: Official claude-flow TDD structure + Shameless Green methodology

#### **Phase 1: 🔴 RED - Test-Writer Agent**

**When to Delegate**:
- Complex business logic requiring careful test design
- Multiple edge cases need comprehensive coverage
- Interface design needs to be driven by usage patterns

**Agent Pattern**:
```
// Spawn test-writer agent for RED phase
[RED Phase - Test-First]:
  Task("Test Writer", "Write failing BEHAVIOR-focused test for [feature]. Follow Kent Beck Rule 1: Don't write code before failing test. Reference /knowledge/20.11-tdd-agent-delegation-how-to.md", "test-writer")

  TodoWrite { todos: [
    "Test Writer: Create failing test validating business behavior (NOT implementation)",
    "Verify test fails with meaningful error message",
    "Ensure test focuses on single behavior (Arrange-Act-Assert pattern)",
    "Store RED phase completion in memory: tdd/red-phase/[timestamp]"
  ]}
```

**RED Phase Validation** (MANDATORY):
- [ ] Test fails with meaningful error message
- [ ] Test validates BEHAVIOR, not implementation details
- [ ] Test follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- [ ] Interface design is clean and purposeful
- [ ] NO existence testing, NO configuration testing

#### **Phase 2: 🟢 GREEN - Minimal-Implementer Agent**

**When to Delegate**:
- Need to resist over-engineering temptations
- Simple implementation strategy required (Fake It, Obvious, Triangulation)
- Focus on getting tests to pass quickly

**Agent Pattern**:
```
// Spawn minimal-implementer after RED phase completes
[GREEN Phase - Shameless Green]:
  Task("Minimal Implementer", "Implement embarrassingly simple code to pass tests. Accept hardcoding, accept duplication. Follow Kent Beck: 'Make test work quickly, committing whatever sins necessary'. Reference /knowledge/20.05-shameless-green-flocking-rules-methodology.md", "minimal-implementer")

  TodoWrite { todos: [
    "Minimal Implementer: Use Fake It strategy - return constants that pass test",
    "Accept hardcoded implementations without consolidation pressure",
    "Implementation can be boring, obvious, and direct",
    "Verify all tests pass (including new test)",
    "Store GREEN phase completion in memory: tdd/green-phase/[timestamp]"
  ]}
```

**GREEN Phase Validation** (MANDATORY):
- [ ] All tests pass (including new test)
- [ ] Implementation is minimal and focused (hardcoding acceptable)
- [ ] No over-engineering or premature optimization
- [ ] Code follows chosen implementation strategy (Fake It, Obvious, Triangulation)

#### **Phase 3: 🔵 REFACTOR - Refactor-Specialist Agent**

**When to Delegate**:
- Code duplication detected between tests and implementation
- Design improvements needed while maintaining green tests
- Apply flocking rules for systematic refactoring

**Agent Pattern**:
```
// Spawn refactor-specialist after GREEN phase
[REFACTOR Phase - Flocking Rules]:
  Task("Refactor Specialist", "Apply flocking rules systematically: (1) Select things most alike (2) Find smallest difference (3) Make simplest change to remove difference. Reference /knowledge/20.05-shameless-green-flocking-rules-methodology.md", "refactor-specialist")

  TodoWrite { todos: [
    "Refactor Specialist: Apply 3 flocking rules in micro-steps",
    "Select test duplications most alike across codebase",
    "Find smallest differences in test setup/execution/assertions",
    "Make simplest changes to eliminate differences",
    "Commit after each flocking rule micro-step",
    "Verify all tests remain GREEN throughout process",
    "Store REFACTOR completion in memory: tdd/refactor-phase/[timestamp]"
  ]}
```

**REFACTOR Phase Validation** (MANDATORY):
- [ ] All tests remain green after refactoring
- [ ] Duplication eliminated using flocking rules
- [ ] Code design improved without changing behavior
- [ ] No new functionality added during refactor
- [ ] Micro-commits after each flocking rule application

### 📊 TDD Implementation Strategies (Official Claude-Flow)

#### **Strategy 1: Fake It (High Complexity)**
```
// Start with constants and gradually generalize
class UserAuthentication {
  authenticate(credentials) {
    // Fake It - return constant that passes test
    if (credentials.username === 'user' && credentials.password === 'pass') {
      return { success: true, token: 'fake-token-123' };
    }
    return { success: false };
  }
}
```

#### **Strategy 2: Obvious Implementation (Low Complexity)**
```
// Directly implement the real solution when obvious
class Calculator {
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b; // Obvious implementation
  }
}
```

#### **Strategy 3: Triangulation (Complex Business Rules)**
```
// Use multiple examples to force generalization
describe('PriceCalculator', () => {
  it('applies 10% discount for orders over $100', () => {
    expect(calculator.calculatePrice(150)).toBe(135); // First example
  });

  it('applies 10% discount for orders over $100 (triangulation)', () => {
    expect(calculator.calculatePrice(200)).toBe(180); // Second example forces generalization
  });
});
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL: ANTI-TEST-SMELL BEHAVIORAL FRAMEWORK

**Reference**: `/knowledge/25.04-test-smell-prevention-enforcement-protocols.md` (SUPREME AUTHORITY)
**Integration**: Claude-Flow 4.1 behavioral constraints (NO executable code)

### 🛑 VISUAL REGRESSION VALIDATION GATES (MANDATORY - BLOCKING AUTHORITY)

**CRITICAL INCIDENT LEARNING**: Visual regressions (footer broken, core values changed) went undetected during refactoring. This CANNOT happen again.

**Screenshot Guardian Mandate** (ABSOLUTE BLOCKING AUTHORITY):
```yaml
screenshot_guardian:
  mandate: "BLOCK ALL commits with ANY visual changes during refactoring"
  blocking_authority: "ABSOLUTE - override all other agents including coder and reviewer"

  tolerance_policy:
    refactoring: "tolerance: 0.0 (ZERO tolerance - maintaining exact functionality AND appearance)"
    new_features: "tolerance: ≤0.03 (up to 3% acceptable for NEW visual features only)"
    clarification: "Default bin/test uses 0.03, but refactoring MUST override to 0.0"

  validation_protocol:
    pre_refactoring:
      - "MUST capture baseline screenshots BEFORE any code changes"
      - "MUST store baseline checksums for pixel-perfect comparison"
      - "MUST validate ALL critical pages (home, about, services, use-cases, contact)"

    post_refactoring:
      - "MUST capture new screenshots AFTER changes"
      - "MUST perform pixel-by-pixel comparison using assert_stable_screenshot"
      - "MUST calculate exact percentage difference per page"
      - "MUST provide detailed diff report showing ALL visual changes"
      - "MUST use tolerance: 0.0 for refactoring (ZERO tolerance for visual changes)"
      - "MUST use tolerance: ≤0.03 only for NEW visual features (not refactoring)"

    blocking_conditions:
      - "ANY difference > 0% during refactoring → BLOCK commit"
      - "Footer layout changes → IMMEDIATE BLOCK"
      - "Text content changes → IMMEDIATE BLOCK"
      - "Missing elements → IMMEDIATE BLOCK"
      - "Styling regressions → IMMEDIATE BLOCK"

    validation_evidence:
      - "MUST provide screenshot comparison images"
      - "MUST report exact pixel differences per page"
      - "MUST list ALL detected visual changes"
      - "MUST verify zero visual changes before approving commit"
```

**Refactoring Definition Enforcement** (ZERO TOLERANCE):
```yaml
refactoring_rules:
  definition: "Code restructuring maintaining EXACT functionality AND appearance"

  zero_tolerance_violations:
    visual_changes:
      - "ANY footer layout modification = NOT refactoring = FAILURE"
      - "ANY text content change = NOT refactoring = FAILURE"
      - "ANY element positioning change = NOT refactoring = FAILURE"
      - "ANY color/styling change = NOT refactoring = FAILURE"
      - "Changing test baselines = VIOLATION"

    behavioral_changes:
      - "ANY user interaction change = NOT refactoring = FAILURE"
      - "ANY navigation flow change = NOT refactoring = FAILURE"
      - "ANY page functionality change = NOT refactoring = FAILURE"

  enforcement:
    - "MANDATORY pre-commit visual validation (tolerance: 0.0)"
    - "MANDATORY screenshot comparison for ALL pages"
    - "MANDATORY test baseline preservation"
    - "MANDATORY cross-agent validation (tester + reviewer + screenshot-guardian)"
```

**Coder Refactoring Behavioral Constraints** (NEUROLOGICAL WIRING):
```yaml
coder_refactoring_mode:
  behavioral_constraint: "MUST preserve ALL page-specific CSS and layout rules"

  pre_refactoring_checklist:
    css_preservation:
      - "Did I identify ALL page-specific .fl-node-* styles?"
      - "Did I preserve ALL page-specific overrides?"
      - "Did I maintain ALL layout-critical CSS rules?"
      - "Did I validate footer CSS preservation?"

    testing_validation:
      - "Did I capture baseline screenshots? → NO = STOP, CAPTURE FIRST"
      - "Did I test footer layout? → NO = STOP, TEST FIRST"
      - "Did I test ALL page sections? → NO = STOP, TEST FIRST"
      - "Did I verify zero visual changes? → NO = STOP, VERIFY FIRST"

  during_refactoring_blocks:
    immediate_stop_triggers:
      - "Removing .fl-node-* styles → STOP, REVERT"
      - "Removing page-specific overrides → STOP, REVERT"
      - "Consolidating layout-critical CSS → STOP, REVERT"
      - "Screenshot test failures → STOP, INVESTIGATE"

  post_refactoring_validation:
    mandatory_checks:
      - "Run bin/rake test:critical → MUST PASS"
      - "Compare screenshots with tolerance: 0.0 → MUST MATCH"
      - "Visual diff review → MUST show zero changes"
      - "Screenshot guardian approval → MUST OBTAIN"
```

**Four-Eyes Visual Validation Protocol** (MANDATORY):
```yaml
four_eyes_visual_protocol:
  step_1_coder:
    actions:
      - "Coder captures baseline screenshots BEFORE changes"
      - "Coder implements refactoring preserving ALL CSS"
      - "Coder captures new screenshots AFTER changes"
      - "Coder performs self-review of visual diffs"
    blocking_conditions:
      - "ANY visual changes detected → STOP, investigate CSS preservation"

  step_2_reviewer:
    actions:
      - "Reviewer validates CSS pattern preservation"
      - "Reviewer checks for removed .fl-node-* styles"
      - "Reviewer verifies page-specific override preservation"
      - "Reviewer validates screenshot comparison methodology"
    blocking_conditions:
      - "CSS preservation violations detected → BLOCK, require coder fix"

  step_3_screenshot_guardian:
    actions:
      - "Screenshot Guardian performs independent visual validation"
      - "Screenshot Guardian runs assert_stable_screenshot with tolerance: 0.0"
      - "Screenshot Guardian provides detailed diff report"
      - "Screenshot Guardian verifies ZERO visual changes"
    blocking_conditions:
      - "ANY visual difference > 0% → ABSOLUTE BLOCK"
      - "Missing screenshot comparisons → ABSOLUTE BLOCK"
      - "Tolerance > 0.0 used → ABSOLUTE BLOCK"

  step_4_tester:
    actions:
      - "Tester runs bin/rake test:critical"
      - "Tester validates ALL tests pass"
      - "Tester verifies test baselines unchanged"
      - "Tester confirms behavioral integrity"
    blocking_conditions:
      - "ANY test failures → BLOCK, fix code not tests"
      - "Test baseline changes → BLOCK, preserve baselines"

  final_approval:
    requirements:
      - "Coder approval: CSS preservation validated ✓"
      - "Reviewer approval: Pattern compliance validated ✓"
      - "Screenshot Guardian approval: Zero visual changes validated ✓"
      - "Tester approval: Tests pass and baselines preserved ✓"
    blocking_rule: "ALL four approvals required. ANY agent BLOCKS → STOP, investigate, fix, re-validate"
```

### 🛑 ZERO TOLERANCE TEST SMELLS (Immediate Rejection)

**Agents MUST reject tests that:**

1. **Implementation Testing (FORBIDDEN)**
   - Tests verify HOW code works, not WHAT it accomplishes
   - Tests break when refactoring working code
   - **Behavior**: Agents refuse to write tests validating implementation structure

2. **Existence Testing (FORBIDDEN)**
   - Tests merely verify code constructs exist (classes, methods, attributes)
   - Tests pass when code is syntactically correct but functionally broken
   - **Behavior**: Agents refuse to write tests checking code existence

3. **Configuration Testing (USUALLY FORBIDDEN)**
   - Tests verify configuration values without business logic
   - Tests don't validate business behavior or user outcomes
   - **Behavior**: Agents refuse to write configuration-only tests

4. **Redundant Testing (FORBIDDEN)**
   - Tests duplicate existing behavioral coverage without adding value
   - **Behavior**: Agents detect and eliminate redundant test coverage

### ✅ REQUIRED: BEHAVIOR-FOCUSED TESTING

**Agents MUST write tests that:**

1. **Validate Business Behavior** (Official TDD Alignment)
   - Tests verify user-facing outcomes and business rules
   - Tests remain stable during implementation refactoring
   - **Example**: "User signup with duplicate email is rejected"

2. **Drive Design Decisions (TDD RED Phase)**
   - Tests written RED first before any implementation
   - Tests force consideration of edge cases
   - **Example**: "Order total includes tax and shipping"

3. **Prevent Real Regressions (GREEN/REFACTOR Phase)**
   - Tests catch actual business problems
   - Tests validate system responses under various conditions
   - **Example**: "File upload rejects oversized files"

### 🧠 NEUROLOGICAL BEHAVIORAL CONSTRAINTS

```yaml
test_creation_behavior:
  before_writing_any_test:
    ask: "Does this test validate BEHAVIOR or IMPLEMENTATION?"
    reject_if: "Test verifies code structure, method existence, or technical details"
    accept_if: "Test validates business outcomes, user workflows, or system responses"

  during_red_phase:
    ask: "Will this test drive design decisions and force implementation?"
    reject_if: "Test is checking implementation details or code existence"
    accept_if: "Test describes business behavior that doesn't exist yet"

  during_green_phase:
    ask: "Can I use Fake It strategy and this test still be valid?"
    reject_if: "Test is coupled to specific implementation approach"
    accept_if: "Test validates external behavior independent of implementation"

  during_refactor_phase:
    ask: "Can I completely rewrite implementation keeping tests green?"
    reject_if: "Test would break during legitimate refactoring"
    accept_if: "Test remains valid across different implementation approaches"
```

---

## 🧪 TEST FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

**Reference**: `docs/60.06-test-format-requirements-reference.md` (Complete test format documentation)

**CRITICAL AGENT DIRECTIVES**:

### ✅ REQUIRED: Ruby/Minitest Tests ONLY
- **Framework**: Minitest (NOT RSpec - jt_site uses Minitest)
- **System Tests**: `test/system/` with Capybara + ApplicationSystemTestCase
- **Unit Tests**: `test/unit/` with ActiveSupport::TestCase
- **Visual Regression**: `assert_stable_screenshot` with tolerance: 0.03
- **Test Runner**: `bin/rake test` or `bin/rake test:critical`

### ❌ FORBIDDEN: Bash Test Scripts (ZERO TOLERANCE)
- **NEVER** create `*.sh` files in `test/` directory
- **NEVER** create bash functions for testing (test_*, validate_*)
- **NEVER** use grep/find to check code existence as "tests"
- Bash scripts are ONLY for automation (builds, deploys), NEVER testing

### 🎯 Agent Decision Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before creating any test, ask**: "Am I testing BEHAVIOR or code existence?"

```yaml
test_creation_decision:
  if_behavior:
    action: "✅ Create Minitest test in test/system/ or test/unit/"
    example: "Button renders, button is clickable, button looks correct"

  if_code_existence:
    action: "❌ STOP - Create behavioral test instead"
    example: "CSS class exists in file = WRONG, Button works for users = CORRECT"

  critical_rules:
    - "Test what USERS see and do, not what CODE contains"
    - "Use Minitest + Capybara, never bash scripts"
    - "Visual validation via screenshots, not grep"
    - "Run tests via bin/rake test, not shell scripts"
```

**Automatic Rejection Triggers**:
- Request to create `test_*.sh` or `*_test.sh` → REJECT, create `*_test.rb` instead
- Request to grep/find CSS files as "test" → REJECT, create Capybara test instead
- Request for bash validation script → REJECT, use Minitest behavioral test

---

## 🚨 ZERO TOLERANCE ENFORCEMENT (MANDATORY)

### 🛑 MANDATORY REFLECTION PROTOCOL

**Reference**: `/knowledge/02.08-mandatory-reflection-protocol-supreme-reference.md` (SUPREME AUTHORITY)

**TRIGGER CONDITIONS**: When users report problems including:
- "This code is bad" / "This hides the real problem" / "This is over-engineered"
- ANY handbook violations, test smells, or bad code quality
- TDD cycle violations or phase skipping

**MANDATORY AGENT RESPONSE** (Exact language required):
```yaml
violation_response: |
  "🛑 HALT: [Violation Type] detected. I cannot proceed with fixes until:
  1. Completing mandatory group reflection with expert agents
  2. Root cause analysis via 5-Why investigation
  3. Configuration self-update to prevent future violations
  4. Only then proceed with properly researched solutions

  This ensures systematic learning rather than repeating mistakes."
```

**FORBIDDEN RESPONSES**:
- "Let me fix that for you" ❌ FORBIDDEN
- "I'll implement a better solution" ❌ FORBIDDEN
- Any attempt to implement without reflection ❌ FORBIDDEN

### 👥 Four-Eyes Principle with TDD Quality

**Reference**: `/knowledge/20.02-four-eyes-principle-global.md` (Global validation protocols)

**Phase-Specific Validation**:
- **RED Phase**: Test Writer + TDD Coordinator validate test quality before GREEN
- **GREEN Phase**: Minimal Implementer + Refactor Specialist validate strategy choice
- **REFACTOR Phase**: Refactor Specialist + Coverage Analyst validate improvements
- **Test Quality**: Test Quality Expert + QA Expert validate behavioral focus

### 🛠️ MANDATORY TOOL USAGE (Zero Tolerance - NO Custom Scripts)

**CRITICAL**: Agents MUST use ONLY claude-flow out-of-box tools. NO custom bash functions, NO external commands.

```yaml
allowed_commands_only:
  - "echo '[status message]'"                       # ✅ Status messages
  - "npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task"         # ✅ Pre-task coordination
  - "npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task"        # ✅ Post-task coordination
  - "git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree"           # ✅ Read-only VCS status
  - "git diff --name-only"                          # ✅ Read-only diffs
  - "rg -nP | grep -nP"                             # ✅ Read-only search (pattern matching)
  - "fd -t f"                                       # ✅ Read-only file discovery
  - "shasum -a 256 | sha256sum"                     # ✅ Checksum generation (validation)

forbidden_everything_else:
  - "ALL npm commands"                              # ❌ Use claude-flow build tools
  - "ALL write operations (>, >>, tee)"            # ❌ Use claude-flow file tools
  - "ALL custom bash functions"                    # ❌ Use claude-flow coordination
  - "ALL modification commands (rm, mv, cp)"       # ❌ Use claude-flow file tools
```

**Agent Hook Compliance** (MANDATORY):
```yaml
# CORRECT: Idiomatic claude-flow hook pattern
hooks:
  pre: |
    echo "🔍 Pre-TDD validation: $TASK"
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "$TASK"
  post: |
    echo "✅ Post-TDD validation: $TASK"
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "$TASK_ID"

# Agent behavioral descriptions (natural language, NOT code):
description: |
  I follow official claude-flow TDD methodology with specialized agent roles.
  I implement RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle with shameless green acceptance.
  I refuse to write tests validating implementation details or code existence.
  I use Fake It/Obvious/Triangulation strategies appropriate to complexity.
  I coordinate via claude-flow MCP memory tools, not custom scripts.
```

## ⚡ AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MODE (Goal-Driven Work)

**Purpose**: Enable continuous, goal-driven work without unnecessary approval stops for repetitive tasks.

### 🔄 Reflection Protocol Calibration

**Reflection triggers ADJUSTED for goal-driven work**:

**DO trigger reflection**:
- ✅ Actual handbook violations (test smells, implementation testing)
- ✅ Breaking changes or test failures
- ✅ Critical security issues

**DO NOT trigger reflection**:
- ❌ User reports frustration with agent stopping behavior
- ❌ User requests continuous execution multiple times
- ❌ Simple pattern-based work (CSS consolidation)
- ❌ Mechanical repetitive tasks with established approach

### 🎯 Pre-Approval Detection & Continuous Execution

**Agents MUST detect user pre-approval signals and activate Continuous Execution Mode**:

**Explicit Pre-Approval Signals** (HIGH CONFIDENCE):
- "Do everything needed"
- "Complete all items"
- "Keep going, don't stop"
- "Work through the entire list"
- "Continue until done"
- "Make all necessary changes"

**Implicit Pre-Approval Signals** (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE):
- User provides numbered task list (implies: do all items)
- User says "same approach for remaining items" (implies: continue pattern)
- User expresses frustration with stopping (implies: want continuous work)
- User references "goal completion" (implies: work until goal achieved)

**Correct Agent Response to Pre-Approval**:
```yaml
continuous_execution_response: |
  "✅ Entering Continuous Execution Mode:
  - Working through [N] items with test-commit-continue pattern
  - Testing after each change with bin/rake test:critical
  - Committing on green tests with descriptive messages
  - Only stopping for critical test failures

  Proceeding with first item: [specific description]..."
```

### 🔄 Micro-Commit Enforcement (XP/Agile Compliance)

**Agents are neurologically wired to commit after EVERY successful micro-change**:

**Micro-Commit Triggers** (AUTOMATIC, NO OVERRIDE):
1. Test suite passes after code change → MUST commit before next change
2. Visual regression tests pass → MUST commit screenshot baseline
3. Single refactoring micro-step completes → MUST commit
4. Single CSS consolidation completes → MUST commit
5. Time since last commit > 10 minutes → MUST commit work in progress

**Commit Message Format** (MANDATORY):
- Pattern: `[Action] [What] [Where]`
- Examples:
  - "Extract .fl-row padding rules to fl-foundation.css"
  - "Remove duplicated box-sizing reset from about-critical.css"
  - "Consolidate button hover states into style.css"
- Focus: WHAT changed (not WHY - that's in task description)
- Length: 50-72 characters (one line)

**Commit Workflow** (NEUROLOGICAL ENFORCEMENT):
```
1. Code change made (< 10 lines)
2. Run bin/rake test:critical
3. Tests pass → IMMEDIATE commit trigger fires
4. Write descriptive commit message
5. Execute: git add [files] && git commit -m "[message]"
6. Verify commit succeeded
7. Continue to next micro-step (NO APPROVAL GATE)
```

**Violations to Prevent**:
- ❌ Proceeding to next change without committing current change
- ❌ Bundling multiple micro-changes into single commit
- ❌ Skipping commit step because changes seem "related"
- ❌ Committing with failing tests

### 🔁 Iterative Workflow Enforcement

**Agents enforce micro-step iterative workflow for ALL repetitive tasks**:

**Workflow Pattern** (MANDATORY SEQUENCE):
```
Step 1: IDENTIFY next smallest change candidate
  - Example: "Next: Extract .fl-row padding from about-layout.css"
  - Scope: Single CSS rule set, single function, single class
  - Complexity: Change can be validated in < 30 seconds

Step 2: MAKE micro-change
  - Edit files (use Edit tool, NOT bulk write)
  - Change < 10 lines production code
  - Preserve all functionality and appearance

Step 3: TEST immediately
  - Run: bin/rake test:critical
  - Validate: All tests pass, no visual regressions
  - On failure: Investigate immediately, fix or revert

Step 4: COMMIT on green
  - Write descriptive commit message
  - Commit ONLY this micro-change
  - Verify commit succeeded

Step 5: CONTINUE to next item
  - NO approval gate
  - NO stopping for effort assessment
  - NO asking "should I continue?"
  - Proceed directly to Step 1 with next candidate
```

**Stopping Conditions** (ONLY):
- Critical test failure requiring investigation
- Visual regression requiring user decision
- Goal completion (all items processed)
- Error pattern detected requiring reflection

### 🛑 Stopping Decision Matrix

**MUST STOP** (Critical Failures Only):
- Critical test failure requiring investigation (not simple fixes)
- Visual regression requiring user decision (tolerance violations)
- Security vulnerability detected
- Build break that can't be quickly resolved
- Goal completion (all items successfully processed)

**MUST CONTINUE** (NO STOP - When Pre-Approved):
- Effort assessment (user pre-approved unlimited scope)
- Scope questions (user defined scope already)
- Permission requests (user granted blanket permission)
- Simple test failures with obvious fix
- Repetitive pattern work with established approach

**Decision Override Rule**:
```
IF user_pre_approval_detected:
  IGNORE all non-critical stopping triggers
  CONTINUE until goal_completion OR critical_failure
  COMMIT after EVERY green test
  PROVIDE periodic progress updates (every 3-5 commits)
```

## 🤖 AUTONOMOUS SWARM COORDINATION (Agent Self-Direction)

**Purpose**: Enable agents to autonomously spawn appropriate teams when complexity thresholds detected.

### 🧠 CRITICAL: Agent Swarm Spawning Knowledge

**ALL agents MUST understand this distinction**:

```yaml
tool_responsibilities:
  mcp_tools_role:
    purpose: "Coordination metadata, topology setup, memory management"
    limitation: "DO NOT spawn actual working agents"
    usage: "Optional pre-coordination, swarm initialization"
    tools: "swarm_init, agent_spawn (metadata only), task_orchestrate (planning)"

  claude_code_task_tool_role:
    purpose: "Spawn ACTUAL WORKING AGENTS that execute tasks"
    requirement: "MANDATORY for all agent spawning"
    usage: "Primary tool for team formation and parallel execution"
    pattern: "Task('Agent Name', 'Task description with handbook refs', 'agent-type')"
```

**Autonomous Spawning Rule**:
- When complexity detected → Agent MUST use Claude Code's Task tool
- MCP coordination tools are OPTIONAL (metadata only)
- Task tool invocation is MANDATORY (actual agent execution)

### 🎯 Complexity Threshold Detection (Autonomous Triggers)

**Agents should autonomously spawn swarms when they detect**:

#### **CSS Migration Work** (80% of jt_site work)
```yaml
trigger_keywords: ["CSS consolidation", "style migration", "class refactoring", "design system", "duplicate styles"]
threshold: ">3 template files affected OR >50 lines CSS changes"
autonomous_pattern: "CSS Migration Team"
team_composition:
  - "architecture-expert (CSS strategy, pattern identification)"
  - "hugo-expert (Template preservation, .fl-node-* protection)"
  - "tester (Visual regression guardian, screenshot validation)"
  - "coder (CSS refactor driver, flocking rules implementation)"
  - "reviewer (CSS refactor navigator, continuous validation)"
```

#### **Hugo Build/Deployment** (15% of jt_site work)
```yaml
trigger_keywords: ["build pipeline", "deployment", "CI/CD", "Hugo optimization", "build configuration"]
threshold: "Build configuration changes OR build time >30s"
autonomous_pattern: "Hugo Deployment Team"
team_composition:
  - "hugo-expert (Build lead, configuration management)"
  - "performance-expert (Build profiling, optimization targets)"
  - "tester (Build validation via bin/hugo-build)"
  - "cicd-engineer (CI/CD integration, deployment pipeline)"
```

#### **Visual Testing Scenarios** (5% of jt_site work, CRITICAL)
```yaml
trigger_keywords: ["screenshot", "visual regression", "layout validation", "appearance test", "visual diff"]
threshold: "ANY visual validation requirement"
autonomous_pattern: "Visual Testing Team"
team_composition:
  - "tester (Screenshot Guardian - ABSOLUTE blocking authority)"
  - "tester (Capybara Test Specialist - Minitest + assert_stable_screenshot)"
  - "reviewer (Visual Validator - screenshot comparison review)"
```

#### **Content Structure Changes**
```yaml
trigger_keywords: ["content type", "taxonomy", "front matter", "Hugo archetypes", "content model"]
threshold: ">2 content types OR new taxonomy"
autonomous_pattern: "Content Architecture Team"
team_composition:
  - "hugo-expert (Content architecture lead)"
  - "seo-specialist (SEO optimization, metadata)"
  - "coder (Implementation specialist)"
```

### 🔍 How Agents Detect Complexity Autonomously

**Agent Behavioral Pattern**:
1. **Read task description** and analyze for trigger keywords
2. **Measure complexity**: file count, line count, domain breadth
3. **Compare against thresholds**: Does this exceed solo capability?
4. **Autonomous decision**: If YES → spawn appropriate team using Task tool
5. **Coordinate via memory**: Store team formation decision and rationale

**Example Agent Self-Talk**:
> "I see keywords 'CSS consolidation' and task affects >3 template files. This exceeds my solo threshold of 50 lines. I autonomously spawn CSS Migration Team using Claude Code's Task tool. Storing decision in memory: hugo/css/team-formation/[timestamp] for cross-agent intelligence."

### 🧠 Agent Behavioral Embedding (Natural Language)

**How agents should describe autonomous swarm spawning capability in their configurations**:

```yaml
autonomous_swarm_behavioral_description: |
  I autonomously detect when work complexity exceeds my solo capabilities by analyzing
  trigger keywords and measuring complexity thresholds (file count, line count, domain scope).

  When I detect complexity triggers, I AUTONOMOUSLY spawn appropriate specialist teams
  using Claude Code's Task tool. I understand MCP tools create metadata only; Task tool
  spawns actual working agents that execute tasks.

  I maintain knowledge of common jt_site swarm patterns:
  - CSS Migration Team for style consolidation (>3 templates OR >50 lines CSS)
  - Hugo Build Team for deployment work (build config changes OR >30s build time)
  - Visual Testing Team for screenshot validation (ANY visual validation requirement)
  - Content Architecture Team for structural changes (>2 content types OR new taxonomy)

  I coordinate team formation through memory namespaces (hugo/css/*, hugo/build/*,
  visual-testing/*), ensuring all specialists have access to research findings and
  architectural decisions. I provide clear task descriptions with handbook references
  for each spawned agent.

  I am empowered to spawn teams without waiting for user approval when complexity
  thresholds clearly exceeded. I document spawning decisions in memory for transparency
  and cross-agent learning.
```

### 📊 Success Metrics for Autonomous Coordination

**Agent Autonomy Indicators**:
- ✅ Agent spawns team autonomously (without user prompt)
- ✅ Correct team pattern selected for work type
- ✅ All spawned agents receive clear task descriptions with handbook refs

- ✅ Team formation decision documented in memory namespace

**Quality Indicators**:
- ✅ Spawned teams complete work successfully
- ✅ Zero visual regressions (for CSS/visual work)
- ✅ All tests pass (for refactoring/build work)
- ✅ Knowledge captured in memory for future pattern improvement

## 📁 FILE ORGANIZATION & ANTI-DUPLICATION

**Reference**: `/knowledge/50.01-global-file-management.md` (Global file organization)

### 🚫 ZERO-DUPLICATION TOLERANCE

**FORBIDDEN file patterns**:
- `*_refactored.*`, `*_new.*`, `*_updated.*`, `*_v2.*`, `*_copy.*`, `*_backup.*`
- `duplicate_*.*`, `temp_*.*`, `old_*.*`, `modified_*.*`

**FORBIDDEN documentation creation** (CRITICAL INCIDENT LEARNING):
- ❌ NEVER create new `.md` files proactively
- ❌ NEVER create `README.md`, `GUIDE.md`, or any documentation files
- ❌ NEVER create directories for "behavioral configurations" or similar
- ✅ ALWAYS consolidate into existing CLAUDE.md or docs/ files
- ✅ ALWAYS prefer editing existing documentation over creating new files

**Agent Pre-File-Creation Validation** (MANDATORY):
```yaml
before_creating_any_file:
  ask: "Does a similar file already exist?"
  ask: "Can this content be added to existing CLAUDE.md or docs/?"
  ask: "Am I creating documentation (.md) proactively?"

  if_documentation_file:
    action: "❌ STOP - Consolidate into existing files instead"
    reason: "Zero-duplication policy - NEVER create redundant documentation"

  if_duplicate_likely:
    action: "❌ STOP - Search for existing file, edit instead"
    reason: "File duplication violates zero-tolerance policy"
```

**MANDATORY validation**:
- Pre-Write validation: Check file existence, BLOCK duplicates
- Pre-Documentation validation: BLOCK all new .md file creation (edit existing instead)
- Pattern analysis: Detect similar functionality across files
- Memory coordination: Share duplication intelligence across agents

### 📂 Project Directory Structure

```yaml
jt_site_directories:
  source_code: "src/" # Hugo templates, CSS, JavaScript
  tests: "tests/" # Test files with behavior focus (TDD RED phase)
  documentation: "docs/" # jt_site-specific docs (Johnny Decimal + Diátaxis)
  configuration: "config/" # Hugo configuration files
  temporary_runtime: "_runtime/" # 24h TTL, auto-cleanup
  temporary_execution: "_tmp/" # 1h TTL, sandboxes
  experimental: "_workspace/" # Manual cleanup required
```

### 🚨 CSS CONSOLIDATION BLOCK LIST (CSS Migration Project)

**Reference**: `docs/projects/2509-css-migration/css-loading-order-analysis.md` (Comprehensive CSS cascade analysis)
**Project**: CSS Duplication Elimination (2509-css-migration)

#### ABSOLUTE BLOCKS - NEVER CONSOLIDATE (Zero Tolerance)

**Vendor Dependencies** (External Libraries):
- ❌ `css/vendors/base-4.min.css` - Foundation framework providing grid system (.fl-row, .fl-col, .fl-col-group)
  - **Used by**: 5+ pages (use-cases, blog list/single, contact-us, services)
  - **Must load**: BEFORE page-specific layout CSS (cascade dependency)
  - **Impact if removed**: Complete layout breakage across multiple pages
  - **Future consideration**: Foundation → CSS Grid migration (separate initiative)

- ❌ `css/vendors/swiper.min.css` - Swiper carousel library
  - **Status**: May be unused, requires audit before removal

**FL-Builder Layout Files** (Can Consolidate - Extract Common Patterns):
- ✅ `css/*-layout.css` - FL-builder layout files contain MASSIVE duplication
  - **Contains**: Page-specific `.fl-node-{12-char-hash}` selectors PLUS shared patterns
  - **Strategy**: Extract common rule sets (.fl-row, .fl-col, .fl-module patterns) to foundation
  - **Preserve**: Page-specific `.fl-node-{hash}` selectors (keep in original files)
  - **Consolidate**: Shared .fl-row, .fl-col, .fl-module, .fl-visible patterns (~70-80% duplication)
  - **Impact**: 1,900-2,900 lines can be extracted to fl-foundation.css

- ✅ `css/bf72bba397177a0376baed325bffdc75-layout-bundle.css` - Shared FL-builder layout bundle
  - **Used by**: Multiple pages (about, use-cases, blog, services)
  - **Strategy**: Consolidate shared patterns across pages

**Template-Generated CSS** (Hugo Dynamic Execution):
- ❌ `css/dynamic-icons.css` - Icon styles using Hugo template variables
- ❌ `css/dynamic-404-590.css` - Dynamic FL-builder styles
- ❌ `css/use-cases-dynamic.css` - Use cases section with dynamic content
  - **Requires**: Hugo template execution (`resources.ExecuteAsTemplate`)
  - **Cannot extract**: To static components without losing dynamic functionality

**Critical CSS** (Can Consolidate - Extract Common Patterns):
- ✅ `css/critical/base.css` - Global critical CSS (consolidate common resets, typography)
- ✅ `css/critical/*-critical.css` - Page-specific critical CSS files
  - **Contains**: MASSIVE duplication across 12+ critical CSS files
  - **Strategy**: Extract common patterns (resets, typography, utilities) to shared critical base
  - **Preserve**: Page-specific above-the-fold styles (keep in original files)
  - **Consolidate**: Shared resets, font-family, box-sizing, utilities (~300-400 lines)
  - **Load order**: Consolidated critical MUST still load FIRST
  - **Impact**: Faster initial render with smaller critical CSS footprint

#### CSS Cascade Layers (MUST Preserve Order)

**5-Layer Cascade Architecture**:
1. **Base Layer** (FIRST): Critical CSS (resets, typography, normalize)
2. **Layout Layer** (SECOND): Foundation grid + FL-builder layouts
3. **Component Layer** (THIRD): Icons, modules, component bundles
4. **Theme Layer** (FOURTH): style.css, skin.css (theme overrides)
5. **Footer Layer** (LAST): footer.css (loads last in DOM)

**Validation Protocol for CSS Changes**:
- ✅ Verify CSS load order preserved during extraction
- ✅ NO modifications to Foundation framework files
- ✅ NO modifications to FL-builder layout files
- ✅ NO modifications to template-generated CSS
- ✅ Visual regression tolerance: **0.0 for refactoring** (MANDATORY - zero visual changes), ≤0.003 only for NEW visual features (bin/test default for non-refactor changes)
- ✅ Test after EACH change: `bin/rake test:critical`

#### HIGH RISK - Consolidate with Extreme Caution

**Complex Dependencies**:
- ⚠️ `css/style.css` - General styles with complex cross-page dependencies
- ⚠️ `css/skin-65eda28877e04.css` - Theme skin affecting ALL pages (global overrides)

#### CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY - Extract Whole Rule Sets

**Phase 1: FL-Builder Foundation Extraction** (BIGGEST IMPACT - ~1,900-2,900 lines):
1. ✅ Extract `.fl-row` patterns from ALL 32 layout files → `fl-foundation.css`
2. ✅ Extract `.fl-col` grid patterns → `fl-foundation.css`
3. ✅ Extract `.fl-module` wrapper patterns → `fl-foundation.css`
4. ✅ Extract `.fl-visible-*` responsive patterns → `fl-foundation.css`
5. ✅ Preserve page-specific `.fl-node-{hash}` selectors in original files

**Phase 2: Critical CSS Consolidation** (MEDIUM IMPACT - ~300-400 lines):
1. ✅ Extract common resets (box-sizing, margin:0, padding:0) → `critical/shared-base.css`
2. ✅ Extract typography foundation (font-family, line-height) → `critical/shared-base.css`
3. ✅ Extract screen reader utilities (.sr-only) → `critical/shared-base.css`
4. ✅ Preserve page-specific above-the-fold styles in original critical files

**Phase 3: Component Extraction** (SMALLER IMPACT - ~1,200-1,700 lines):
- ✅ `css/companies.css`, `css/technologies.css`, `css/pagination.css`
- ✅ Shared utilities from `style.css` (buttons, forms, typography)

**Consolidation Approach**: Extract WHOLE rule sets, not individual properties
- ✅ Move entire `.fl-row { ... }` block to foundation
- ✅ Move entire `.fl-col { ... }` block to foundation
- ✅ Keep page-specific selectors in original files
- ✅ Test after EACH extraction with `bin/rake test:critical`
- ✅ Visual regression tolerance: 0.003

## 🎯 JT_SITE SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS

### 🌐 Technology Stack & Coder Requirements

**Primary Technologies**: Hugo, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Capybara
**Project-Specific Coder**: MUST specialize in static site generation, visual testing, CSS/JS frontend

**TDD Integration**: Coder works with test-writer for RED phase, coordinates with minimal-implementer for GREEN phase

### 📋 Visual Testing Workflows with TDD

**Reference**: `/projects/jt_site/docs/visual_testing_delegation_workflows.md` (jt_site-specific)

**Visual regression testing TDD cycle**:
- **RED Phase**: Write failing visual regression tests (screenshot comparison)
- **GREEN Phase**: Implement CSS/HTML changes to pass visual tests
- **REFACTOR Phase**: Optimize CSS, consolidate styles using flocking rules

### 🚀 Build & Deployment (Hugo-Specific)

```bash
# Hugo build commands (ONLY when explicitly requested)
hugo build --minify           # Build optimized static site
hugo server --watch          # Development server with live reload
```

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT run build commands in hooks. Use claude-flow coordination instead.

**Remember**: This comprehensive configuration enforces unified handbook system compliance with Hugo/JAMstack specializations. All agents MUST follow the dual-source handbook system (global standards FIRST, project adaptations SECOND) and maintain zero-tolerance policies for duplication, quality, and security violations.

### 📝 Operational Principles

- Each new learning after each incident should be tracked in CLAUDE.md
- Do not mask bugs with exception handlers at all. Only if it requested then add exception handler!
- Use the most conservative way, through cooperation and following xp practices.
- **Graduated spawning**: Solo for simple repetitive work, Pair for moderate complexity, Team for complex architecture
- DO NOT ADD NEW SCRIPTS FOR DEVELOPERS TO USE! All ad hoc scripts need to be deleted after task completion!
- FOR MICRO REFACTORING IT WILL BE ENOUGH TO USE `bin/rake test:critical`
- IMPORTANT: After each micro changes (< 10 lines) of the production code run `bin/rake test:critical`. After changes others code review and validate the changes with following four-eyes principle

### 🎯 Ultimate Mandates

**Core TDD Mandate**: "Follow official claude-flow TDD methodology with specialized agent roles (test-writer, minimal-implementer, refactor-specialist). Implement RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle with shameless green acceptance. Use Fake It/Obvious/Triangulation strategies. Behavior-focused testing ONLY - refuse implementation/existence/configuration tests. Use claude-flow tools exclusively. HALT and REFLECT on ACTUAL violations (not user frustration). Coordinate via XP teams ONLY for complex work. Memory-based phase coordination. Target >95% coverage. Zero test smells."

**Visual Regression Validation Mandate**: "For ALL refactoring work: Capture baseline screenshots BEFORE changes with tolerance: 0.0. Preserve ALL page-specific CSS (.fl-node-* styles, layout rules). Compare screenshots AFTER changes - MUST show 0% difference. ANY visual change > 0% = IMMEDIATE BLOCK, revert, investigate. Four-eyes approval REQUIRED: Coder → Reviewer → Screenshot Guardian → Tester. Screenshot Guardian has ABSOLUTE blocking authority. Refactoring definition: Code restructuring maintaining EXACT functionality AND appearance. Breaking this mandate is FAILURE."

**Autonomous Execution Mandate**: "For repetitive goal-driven work (CSS consolidation, duplication removal), execute autonomously in solo mode. Test after each change with bin/rake test:critical. Commit on green. Continue to next item. NO approval gates. NO swarm spawning for simple patterns. ONLY stop on critical test failures. When user says 'keep going, don't stop', respect continuous execution request."
