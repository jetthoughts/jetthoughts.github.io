# Claude Code Configuration - Agile SPARC Development Environment

## üèÉ AGILE SPRINT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### ‚ö° CRITICAL DISTINCTION: Sprints vs Iterations vs Micro-Refactoring

**IMPORTANT**: This configuration properly separates three distinct concepts:

```yaml
hierarchy_clarification:
  sprints:
    definition: "2-week development periods for major goal achievement"
    duration: "14 days"
    team_capacity: "400 hours (5 developers √ó 2 weeks √ó 40 hours)"
    contains: "2 weekly iterations"
    focus: "Sprint goal delivery and stakeholder value"
    
  iterations:
    definition: "1-week development cycles within sprints"
    duration: "7 days"
    team_capacity: "200 hours (5 developers √ó 40 hours)"
    purpose: "Focused development work with rapid feedback"
    planning_unit: "Primary unit for capacity and story planning"
    
  micro_refactoring:
    definition: "Quality technique for safe code changes during development"
    scope: "Individual code modifications within iteration tasks"
    size_limit: "3 lines per change, 50 lines per task"
    purpose: "Maintain code quality and prevent regressions"
    relationship: "Technique used WITHIN iteration development work"

key_understanding:
  - "Iterations are NOT 3-line changes"
  - "Iterations are 1-week development cycles with 5 developers"
  - "Micro-refactoring is a quality technique used during iterations"
  - "WIP limits apply at iteration level, not micro-change level"
```

### üìÖ Sprint and Iteration Structure

**SPRINT FRAMEWORK**: 2-week sprints containing 2 weekly iterations for focused development cycles.

```yaml
sprint:
  number: 1
  name: "Foundation Sprint"
  duration: "2 weeks"  # Contains 2 weekly iterations
  start_date: "2025-01-06"
  end_date: "2025-01-20"
  velocity_target: 40
  total_capacity: 400  # hours (5 developers √ó 2 weeks √ó 40 hours)
  
iteration_structure:
  iteration_1:
    duration: "1 week"
    dates: "2025-01-06 to 2025-01-12"
    team_size: 5  # developers
    capacity_per_developer: 40  # hours per week
    total_iteration_capacity: 200  # hours (5 √ó 40)
    focus: "Foundation setup and core implementation"
    
  iteration_2:
    duration: "1 week"
    dates: "2025-01-13 to 2025-01-20"
    team_size: 5  # developers
    capacity_per_developer: 40  # hours per week
    total_iteration_capacity: 200  # hours (5 √ó 40)
    focus: "Integration, testing, and sprint goal completion"

team_capacity_calculation:
  developers: 5
  hours_per_developer_per_week: 40
  weekly_iteration_capacity: 200  # hours
  sprint_capacity: 400  # hours (2 iterations)
  focus_factor: 75%  # actual productive time
  effective_sprint_capacity: 300  # hours
```

### üéØ WIP LIMITS ENFORCEMENT (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: All development MUST follow strict WIP limits at iteration and developer levels:**

```yaml
wip_limits:
  # Organizational Level
  active_goals: 1        # Only ONE goal at a time
  active_sprints: 1      # Only ONE sprint active
  active_iterations: 1   # Only ONE iteration active at a time
  
  # Team Level (per iteration)
  active_job_stories: 3  # Maximum 3 stories in progress (5 developers)
  active_tasks: 5        # One task per developer maximum
  
  # Developer Level
  stories_per_developer: 1     # Only ONE story per developer
  tasks_per_developer: 1       # Only ONE task per developer
  micro_changes_per_task: unlimited  # 3-line changes within tasks
  
wip_enforcement:
  iteration_level: true    # Enforce at weekly iteration level
  developer_level: true    # Enforce at individual developer level
  micro_change_level: false # Micro-refactoring is a technique, not WIP unit
  block_exceeding: true
  alert_at_100_percent: true
  auto_validation: true
  cooperative_decomposition: required
```

## üìö KNOWLEDGE-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

**This project follows comprehensive knowledge management practices. All agents MUST consult the structured knowledge base before proposing solutions.**

**Knowledge Base Location**: `/knowledge/` - Complete practices, processes, solutions, and templates
**Documentation Base Location**: `/docs/` - Project documentation and architectural decisions
**Knowledge Index**: `/knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md` - Navigation guide for all knowledge

### üéØ Core Knowledge Principles
1. **Package-Search Priority Development**: Use `package-search` MCP as PRIMARY tool for dependency research, `claude-context` for local patterns, `context7` as fallback only. MANDATORY: AC.82.01
2. **Pattern Consistency**: Follow established patterns from knowledge base solutions
3. **Quality Assurance**: Apply comprehensive validation checklists for all implementations
4. **Security-First**: Implement security practices from knowledge base frameworks
5. **TDD Methodology**: Follow test-driven development from knowledge base practices
6. **Agile Compliance**: Follow sprint boundaries, WIP limits, and cooperative decomposition

### üéØ Quality Framework Integration (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL UPDATE**: All Hugo site development agents MUST follow the enhanced quality framework for zero-defect development.

#### Quality Framework References (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

- **`/knowledge/90.01-zero-defect-philosophy-explanation.md`** - Zero-Defect Philosophy (MANDATORY CONSULTATION)
- **`/knowledge/90.02-prevention-first-methodology-how-to.md`** - Prevention-First Methodology
- **`/knowledge/90.03-consistency-pattern-library-reference.md`** - Consistency Pattern Library
- **`/knowledge/36.01-technical-debt-elimination-how-to.md`** - Technical Debt Elimination Protocols

#### Enhanced Quality Gate Coordination

```yaml
quality_framework_integration:
  zero_defect_philosophy: true
  prevention_first_methodology: required
  consistency_pattern_validation: true
  technical_debt_elimination: mandatory
  
hugo_quality_coordination_hooks:
  pre_task_quality_validation: |
    # Consult quality framework before any Hugo site task
    echo "üìä Quality Framework Consultation: $TASK"
    echo "   - AC.90.01: Zero-Defect Philosophy"
    echo "   - AC.90.02: Prevention-First Methodology" 
    echo "   - AC.90.03: Consistency Pattern Library"
    echo "   - AC.36.01: Technical Debt Elimination"
    
  during_task_quality_monitoring: |
    # Continuous quality validation during Hugo development
    echo "üîç Quality Monitoring: Ensuring zero-defect site quality"
    
  post_task_quality_assessment: |
    # Final quality compliance validation
    echo "‚úÖ Quality Assessment Complete: Zero defects in site development"
```

#### Hugo Site Quality Considerations

**Hugo-Specific Quality Framework Application:**

1. **Content Quality**: Zero tolerance for broken links, missing images, or malformed markdown
2. **Performance Quality**: Optimal build times and fast page loading with proper optimization
3. **Accessibility Quality**: Full compliance with WCAG guidelines and semantic HTML
4. **SEO Quality**: Proper metadata, structured data, and search engine optimization
5. **Visual Quality**: Consistent design, responsive layout, and cross-browser compatibility

#### Memory Namespace Patterns for Quality Framework

```bash
# Quality framework coordination namespaces for Hugo site
quality/hugo/zero-defect/*           # Zero-defect validation results
quality/hugo/prevention-first/*      # Prevention-first methodology application
quality/hugo/consistency/*           # Consistency pattern validation
quality/hugo/technical-debt/*        # Technical debt elimination tracking
quality/hugo/content-quality/*       # Content quality validation results

## üóÇÔ∏è KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENTS

### üìã Johnny Decimal + Di√°taxis Compliance (MANDATORY)

**ALL new content in `/knowledge/` and `/docs/` folders MUST follow these standards:**

#### File Naming Convention
```
AC.ID-content-type.md
```

Where:
- **AC** = Area Code (10-99)
- **ID** = Unique identifier within area (01-99)
- **content-type** = Di√°taxis classification

**Example**: `20.15-testing-tutorial.md` (Area 20, ID 15, Tutorial content)

#### Johnny Decimal Areas (Required Structure)
```
10-19  Core Development Practices
20-29  Testing & Quality Assurance
30-39  Architecture & Design Patterns
40-49  Security & Compliance
50-59  Deployment & Operations
60-69  Project Management & Processes
70-79  Templates & Boilerplates
80-89  Integration & APIs
90-99  System Administration
```

#### Di√°taxis Content Classification (Required)
- **tutorial** - Learning-oriented step-by-step guides
- **how-to** - Problem-solving oriented practical guides
- **explanation** - Understanding-oriented theoretical background
- **reference** - Information-oriented lookup materials

### üîç Content Health Standards

#### Mandatory Quality Gates for All Knowledge Content
1. **Structural Integrity**
   - Johnny Decimal compliance check
   - Di√°taxis classification verification
   - Cross-reference validation
   - Naming convention adherence

2. **Content Quality Standards**
   - Clear, actionable headings
   - Consistent terminology usage
   - Complete examples and code snippets
   - Links to related content

3. **Duplication Prevention**
   - Content similarity scanning
   - Redundancy elimination
   - Consolidation recommendations
   - Cross-reference optimization

4. **Consistency Monitoring**
   - Template adherence checking
   - Style guide compliance
   - Formatting standardization
   - Metadata completeness

### üõ°Ô∏è Enforcement Mechanisms

#### Pre-Content Creation Validation
**ALL agents creating knowledge/docs content MUST:**

1. **Research Phase** (Before Writing):
```bash
# Search existing content for duplication
claude-context search "[topic]" --path "/knowledge/" --limit 20
claude-context search "[topic]" --path "/docs/" --limit 20

# Validate Johnny Decimal area assignment
echo "üè∑Ô∏è Assigning Johnny Decimal area for: [topic]"
echo "üîç Checking area availability in current structure"

# Determine Di√°taxis classification
echo "üìö Content type classification:"
echo "- Tutorial: Step-by-step learning guide?"
echo "- How-to: Problem-solving guide?"
echo "- Explanation: Conceptual background?"
echo "- Reference: Lookup information?"
```

2. **Structure Validation** (During Creation):
```bash
# Validate file naming convention
filename_pattern="^[0-9]{2}\.[0-9]{2}-(tutorial|how-to|explanation|reference)\.md$"
echo "‚úÖ Filename follows AC.ID-content-type.md pattern"

# Check Johnny Decimal area consistency
area_code=$(echo "$filename" | cut -d'.' -f1)
echo "üóÇÔ∏è Area code: $area_code - Validating against established areas"

# Verify Di√°taxis classification alignment
content_type=$(echo "$filename" | grep -o '\-(tutorial|how-to|explanation|reference)' | sed 's/-//')
echo "üìñ Content type: $content_type - Validating content structure"
```

3. **Cross-Reference Maintenance** (After Creation):
```bash
# Update knowledge index
echo "üìá Updating /knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md with new entry"

# Validate cross-references
echo "üîó Checking all internal links for validity"

# Trigger reindexing for search optimization
echo "üîÑ Triggering knowledge base reindexing"
```

### üö® Zero-Legacy Knowledge Policy

**CRITICAL: All knowledge management follows zero-legacy tolerance:**

1. **Immediate Compliance**: No grandfathering of existing content - ALL content must be migrated to new structure
2. **Complete Migration**: Partial compliance is not acceptable - full Johnny Decimal + Di√°taxis adoption required
3. **Automated Enforcement**: Pre-commit hooks prevent non-compliant content creation
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time validation of all knowledge/docs changes

### üìä Knowledge Health Metrics

**Required monitoring and reporting:**

1. **Structural Health**: 100% Johnny Decimal + Di√°taxis compliance
2. **Content Quality**: >95% content quality score
3. **Cross-Reference Integrity**: 0 broken internal links
4. **Duplication Rate**: <5% content similarity
5. **Search Optimization**: >90% findability score

## üîÑ COOPERATIVE DECOMPOSITION PROTOCOLS

### üß© Task Decomposition Framework

**MANDATORY: All job stories MUST be cooperatively decomposed following Agile principles:**

```yaml
cooperative_decomposition:
  job_story_breakdown:
    max_story_points: 8
    min_story_points: 1
    ideal_story_points: 3-5
  
  decomposition_process:
    1. "Identify user value delivery"
    2. "Break into testable increments"
    3. "Ensure independent deliverables"
    4. "Validate INVEST criteria"
    5. "Assign story points cooperatively"
  
  invest_criteria:
    independent: required
    negotiable: required
    valuable: required
    estimable: required
    small: required
    testable: required
```

#### Decomposition Agent Coordination
```bash
# Cooperative story decomposition
echo "üß© Starting cooperative decomposition for: $JOB_STORY"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks decompose-story \
  --story "$JOB_STORY" \
  --agents "product-owner,scrum-master,hugo-developer" \
  --validate-invest

# Store decomposition results
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store \
  --key "decomposition/sprint-1/$STORY_ID" \
  --value "$DECOMPOSITION_RESULT"
```

## üß¨ MICRO-REFACTORING DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUE

### Development Quality Protocol (Used Within Iterations)

**IMPORTANT DISTINCTION**: Micro-refactoring is a DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUE used WITHIN weekly iterations, NOT the definition of iterations themselves.

**CLARIFICATION**:
- **ITERATIONS**: 1-week development cycles (200 hours with 5 developers)
- **MICRO-REFACTORING**: Quality technique for making small, safe changes during development
- **SPRINTS**: 2-week periods containing 2 iterations

#### The 3-Line Micro-Refactoring Technique (Quality Practice)
```yaml
micro_refactoring_technique:
  purpose: "Safe, testable changes during iteration development"
  scope: "Individual code changes within iteration tasks"
  max_lines_per_micro_change: 3
  max_total_lines_per_task: 50  # Within iteration tasks
  test_after_each_change: required
  rollback_on_failure: automatic
  continuous_validation: true
  
context_clarification:
  used_within: "Weekly iteration development work"
  not_used_for: "Defining iteration duration or capacity"
  relationship: "Quality technique supporting iteration delivery"
  wip_application: "Applied to individual code changes, not iteration planning"
```

#### Implementation Protocol (Within Iteration Tasks)

**Phase 1: Iteration Task Breakdown**
- Break iteration tasks into small, manageable units
- Apply micro-refactoring technique to individual code changes
- Plan maximum 50 lines total per iteration task
- Identify rollback points for each micro-change
- Ensure each micro-change is independently testable

**Iteration Context**:
- Micro-refactoring applies to code changes WITHIN iteration tasks
- Iteration planning focuses on story delivery and team capacity
- Quality technique supports but doesn't define iteration structure

**Phase 2: Micro-Change Execution** 
```bash
# Execute EVERY change as micro-step
for micro_change in "${micro_changes[@]}"; do
    # 1. Make 3-line change
    apply_micro_change "$micro_change"
    
    # 2. Test immediately
    if ! run_tests; then
        echo "‚ùå ROLLBACK: Micro-change failed tests"
        git checkout -- .
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # 3. Validate working state
    verify_system_stability
done
```

**Phase 3: Continuous Validation**
- Test after EVERY 3-line change
- Validate system remains in working state
- Rollback immediately on any failure
- Document successful micro-patterns

#### Rollback Procedures

**Immediate Rollback Triggers:**
- Any test failure after micro-change
- System instability detected
- Build failure or compilation error
- Performance degradation detected

**Rollback Execution:**
```bash
# Automatic rollback protocol
rollback_micro_change() {
    echo "üîÑ Rolling back failed micro-change..."
    git checkout -- .
    echo "‚úÖ System restored to last working state"
    validate_rollback_success
}
```

#### Agent Integration Requirements

**ALL AGENTS MUST (During Iteration Development):**
1. **Plan iteration tasks**: Decompose iteration work into deliverable units
2. **Apply micro-refactoring**: Use 3-line technique for code changes within tasks
3. **Execute incrementally**: Apply micro-changes one step at a time within tasks
4. **Test continuously**: Validate after each micro-change
5. **Rollback immediately**: Revert failed micro-changes
6. **Document patterns**: Record successful micro-refactoring patterns

**Iteration vs Micro-Refactoring Distinction**:
- **Iteration Planning**: Focus on story delivery, team capacity, weekly goals
- **Micro-Refactoring**: Focus on safe code changes during development
- **Integration**: Micro-refactoring supports iteration delivery quality

#### Handbook Compliance Integration

**Core Handbook Principles (ENFORCED):**
- **Always start fixing bugs with reproduction test**
- **Avoid fallbacks - fail fast, do not hide errors**
- **Do not override or monkey patch external dependencies**  
- **Use always the simplest naive solutions (KISS, YAGNI)**
- **After each new change check tests - rollback on fail**
- **ENFORCE: Use TDD only for adding new behaviors; micro refactoring for refinement**
- **Split work into smallest non-breaking tasks with intensive test verification**
- **Guarantee working solution at any time**
- **Prioritize radical KISS, YAGNI, Readability, Low Cognitive Load**

## üîç PACKAGE-SEARCH MCP PRIORITY (MANDATORY)

**STATUS**: PRODUCTION ACTIVE  
**COMPLIANCE**: MANDATORY for all Hugo/Jekyll dependency research  
**REFERENCE**: AC.82.01 Package-Search MCP Priority

### Core Mandate for jt_site

**ALL Hugo site agents MUST prioritize package-search MCP** for external dependency research:

```yaml
research_hierarchy:
  1_primary: "package-search MCP - npm, golang packages for Hugo/Jekyll"
  2_secondary: "claude-context - local Hugo patterns and config"
  3_fallback: "context7 - documentation only when package-search unavailable"
```

### Required Usage Pattern for Hugo Development

```python
# MANDATORY: Search Hugo-related packages FIRST
mcp__package-search__package_search_hybrid(
    registry_name="npm",  # For Hugo/Jekyll npm packages
    package_name="hugo",  # Or "jekyll", "postcss", etc.
    semantic_queries=["static site generation", "template patterns", "build optimization"],
    pattern=r"hugo|jekyll|static.*site"
)

# For Go packages (Hugo is written in Go)
mcp__package-search__package_search_hybrid(
    registry_name="golang_proxy",
    package_name="gohugoio/hugo",
    semantic_queries=["template rendering", "content processing"],
    pattern=r"func.*Render|type.*Page"
)
```

### Hugo/Jekyll Specific Examples

- **Template patterns**: `semantic_queries=["Hugo template functions", "Jekyll liquid templates"]`
- **Build optimization**: `semantic_queries=["static site build performance", "asset pipeline"]`
- **CSS/PostCSS**: `semantic_queries=["PostCSS configuration", "TailwindCSS Hugo integration"]`
- **SEO patterns**: `semantic_queries=["SEO optimization for static sites"]`

### Validation Requirements

```bash
# Pre-task validation for Hugo agents
echo "üîç Package Search Priority: ACTIVE for Hugo/Jekyll"
echo "üì¶ Searching for static site patterns in: $PACKAGE_NAME"

# Post-task metrics
echo "‚úÖ Package-search utilized for Hugo dependency research"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è VERIFICATION-FIRST DEVELOPMENT (MANDATORY)

### Prevent Regressions Through Verification

**ALL development work MUST start with verification to prevent issues like the PostCSS bug that was "fixed" 3+ times.**

#### Core Principle: Reproduce Before Fix
**No work begins without a failing test that proves the issue exists.**

### The Verification-First Protocol

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ START with Reproduction Test (MANDATORY - BLOCKING)
```javascript
Task("Developer", `
  üö® MANDATORY BLOCKING PROTOCOL - NO EXCEPTIONS:
  
  BEFORE any work:
  1. üö® MUST create reproduction test that FAILS:

     - Store test in memory: reproduction-tests/[ISSUE]/command
     - Document expected failure behavior
  
  3. üö® BLOCKING: Cannot start fix until test fails correctly
     - No work begins without failing reproduction test
     - Verify test reproduces exact issue
  
  MANDATORY TEST ENFORCEMENT:
  - Run bin/test before starting - BLOCKED if fails
  - Run bin/test after reproduction test creation
  - AUTOMATIC rollback on any test regression

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use claude-context for Comprehensive Search (MANDATORY - BLOCKING)
```javascript
Task("Developer", `
  üö® MANDATORY COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH - NO EXCEPTIONS:
  
  BEFORE any fixes:

  2. üö® MUST use claude-context (NOT grep):
     - Index if needed: npx claude-context index_codebase --path "."
     - Search ALL patterns: npx claude-context search_code --query "[issue]" --path "."
     - Search variations: case-sensitive, case-insensitive, partial matches
  
  3. üö® MUST create COMPLETE inventory:
     - Find ALL affected files (not just first few)
     - Include all file types: html, js, css, md, json, yaml
     - Store in memory: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store --key "work/[TASK]/inventory"

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Track Progress with Memory (MANDATORY - BLOCKING)
```javascript
Task("Developer", `
  üö® MANDATORY PROGRESS TRACKING - BLOCKING COMPLETION:
  
  TRACK all changes with TEST VALIDATION:
  
  - After finding each file:
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store --key "work/[TASK]/[FILE]" --value "found"
    
  - After fixing each file:
    üö® MUST run bin/test immediately - AUTOMATIC rollback if fails

### MANDATORY TEMPLATE FOR ALL WORK (BLOCKING ENFORCEMENT)

**ALL development tasks MUST use this template with ZERO TOLERANCE:**

```javascript
Task("Verification-First Developer", `
  üö® MANDATORY VERIFICATION-FIRST PROTOCOL - NO EXCEPTIONS:
  
  üõë PRE-WORK BLOCKING VALIDATION:
  - MUST run bin/test BEFORE starting - BLOCKED if fails
  - Cannot proceed without passing tests
  
  üß™ STEP 1: REPRODUCE (MANDATORY - BLOCKING)
  - üö® MUST write test that FAILS showing the issue
  - üö® MUST run test command: [specific command]
  - üö® BLOCKED from proceeding if test doesn't fail
  - üö® MUST run bin/test after reproduction test
  
  üîç STEP 2: SEARCH (MANDATORY - COMPREHENSIVE)
  - üö® MUST use claude-context: search_code --query "[search]" --path "."
  - üö® MUST find ALL related files (not just first few)
  - üö® MUST list all files found BEFORE starting
  - üö® MUST store complete inventory in memory
  - üö® BLOCKED from starting without complete inventory
  
  üîß STEP 3: FIX (MANDATORY TEST ENFORCEMENT)
  - Fix files systematically ONE AT A TIME
  - üö® MUST run bin/test after EACH file change
  - üö® AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK: git checkout -- . if tests fail
  - üö® CANNOT proceed to next file until tests pass
  - Track progress in memory for each file
  
  ‚úÖ STEP 4: VERIFY (BLOCKING COMPLETION)
  - üö® MUST run reproduction test - MUST now pass
  - üö® MUST run bin/dtest - ALL tests must pass
  - üö® MUST verify bin/build works
  - üö® MUST verify bin/dev works
  - üö® BLOCKED from claiming success until ALL verifications pass
  
  ZERO TOLERANCE: No shortcuts, no exceptions, no bypass
`, "coder")
```

### Why This Prevents Regressions

1. **Reproduction Test**: Ensures we understand the actual problem
2. **claude-context Search**: Finds ALL instances, not just obvious ones
3. **Memory Tracking**: Prevents forgetting what was checked
4. **Empty Cache Testing**: Reveals hidden dependencies

### Memory Pattern (Simplified)

```yaml
work/
  [task_name]/
    test_command     # The reproduction test
    inventory        # All files found
    [file_path]      # Status: found|fixed|verified
```

### Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Search comprehensively
npx claude-context search_code --query "PostCSS" --path "."

# Track in memory
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store --key "work/TASK/file.html" --value "fixed"

# Check progress
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-search --pattern "work/TASK/*" --key "*"

# Verify with empty cache
rm -rf public resources/_gen && hugo --environment production
```

#### Enforcement Mechanisms

```bash
# Hook integration for micro-change validation
pre_change_validation() {
    echo "üß¨ Validating micro-change compliance..."
    
    # Check change size
    local lines_changed=$(git diff --cached --numstat | awk '{sum+=$1+$2} END {print sum}')
    if [[ $lines_changed -gt 3 ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKING: Change exceeds 3-line limit ($lines_changed lines)"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Ensure tests exist and pass
    if ! run_comprehensive_tests; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKING: Tests must pass before micro-change"
        return 1
    fi
}

post_change_validation() {
    echo "üîç Validating micro-change success..."
    
    # Run tests immediately after change
    if ! run_comprehensive_tests; then
        echo "‚ùå ROLLBACK: Tests failed after micro-change"
        git checkout -- .
        return 1
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ Micro-change validated successfully"
}
```

#### Verification Requirements

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION AFTER EACH MICRO-CHANGE (BLOCKING):**

1. **Immediate Test Validation (MANDATORY - BLOCKING)**
   ```bash
   # üö® MUST run after EVERY 3-line change - NO EXCEPTIONS
   mandatory_test_validation() {
       echo "üö® MANDATORY: Testing after micro-change"
       
       # Run comprehensive test suite - BLOCKING
       if ! bin/test; then
           echo "‚ùå AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK: Tests failed"
           git checkout -- .
           echo "üö´ BLOCKED: Cannot proceed with failing tests"
           exit 1
       fi
       
       # Additional validations
       hugo build --verbose --dry-run || { git checkout -- .; exit 1; }
       npm run lint || { git checkout -- .; exit 1; }
       
       echo "‚úÖ Micro-change validation passed"
   }
   ```

2. **System Stability Verification (MANDATORY - BLOCKING)**
   ```bash
   # üö® MUST verify system remains in working state
   mandatory_system_stability() {
       echo "üö® MANDATORY: System stability verification"
       
       # Test Hugo server functionality
       if ! timeout 30 hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 1313 >/dev/null 2>&1 &; then
           echo "‚ùå AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK: Hugo server broken"
           git checkout -- .
           exit 1
       fi
       
       local hugo_pid=$!
       sleep 5
       
       if ! curl -f http://localhost:1313/ >/dev/null 2>&1; then
           kill $hugo_pid 2>/dev/null
           echo "‚ùå AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK: Site not accessible"
           git checkout -- .
           exit 1
       fi
       
       kill $hugo_pid 2>/dev/null
       echo "‚úÖ System stability verified"
   }
   ```

3. **Performance Impact Validation (MANDATORY - BLOCKING)**
   ```bash
   # üö® MUST ensure no performance regression
   mandatory_performance_validation() {
       echo "üö® MANDATORY: Performance regression check"
       
       # Get baseline if not exists
       if [ ! -f ".baseline_build_time" ]; then
           echo "Establishing baseline build time..."
           time hugo build 2>&1 | grep real | awk '{print $2}' > .baseline_build_time
       fi
       
       local baseline=$(cat .baseline_build_time)
       local current=$(time hugo build 2>&1 | grep real | awk '{print $2}')
       
       # Simple comparison (simplified - could be enhanced)
       if [ "$current" != "$baseline" ]; then
           echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Performance change detected: $baseline -> $current"
           # Could implement more sophisticated comparison here
       fi
       
       echo "‚úÖ Performance validation completed"
   }
   ```

**MANDATORY REVERIFICATION PROTOCOL (BLOCKING):**
- üö® ALL agents MUST use paired validation (coder + reviewer) - NO EXCEPTIONS
- üö® Complex changes (>1 micro-step) REQUIRE reviewer agent verification - BLOCKING
- üö® Critical changes (security, architecture) MANDATE paired validation - BLOCKING  
- üö® Simple changes (‚â§3 lines) REQUIRE post-completion validation - BLOCKING
- üö® ALL changes MUST pass bin/test before reviewer validation
- üö® Reviewer MUST run bin/test independently before approval
- üö® BLOCKED from merging without reviewer + test validation
- üö® AUTOMATIC rollback if post-review tests fail

## üö® CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION & FILE MANAGEMENT

**ABSOLUTE RULES**:
1. ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message
2. **NEVER save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder**
3. ALWAYS organize files in appropriate subdirectories
4. **USE CLAUDE CODE'S TASK TOOL** for spawning agents concurrently, not just MCP
5. **ENFORCE WIP LIMITS** - Only 1 goal, 1 sprint, 1 job story, 1 task at a time

### ‚ö° GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**MANDATORY PATTERNS:**
- **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
- **Task tool (Claude Code)**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
- **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
- **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
- **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### üéØ CRITICAL: Agile-Compliant Agent Execution

**Claude Code's Task tool with Agile constraints:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Agile-compliant parallel agent execution with WIP limits
[Single Message - Sprint Task Execution]:
  // Spawn Agile team agents with WIP enforcement
  Task("Product Owner", "Define and validate current job story: $ACTIVE_JOB_STORY. Ensure WIP limits maintained.", "product-owner")
  Task("Scrum Master", "Facilitate sprint coordination and remove impediments. Monitor WIP compliance.", "scrum-master")
  Task("Hugo Developer", "Implement ONLY the active task: $ACTIVE_TASK. Follow micro-change protocol.", "hugo-developer")
  Task("Content Developer", "Support active task with content needs. Maintain focus on single story.", "content-developer")
  Task("QA Engineer", "Test active implementation incrementally. Validate story acceptance criteria.", "qa-engineer")
  
  // Sprint context and WIP validation
  mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage({
    action: "store",
    key: "sprint/1/active_context",
    value: {
      active_goal: "$SPRINT_GOAL",
      active_job_story: "$JOB_STORY_ID",
      active_task: "$TASK_ID",
      wip_compliance: true
    }
  })
```

**MCP tools are ONLY for coordination setup:**
- `mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init` - Initialize coordination topology
- `mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn` - Define agent types for coordination
- `mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate` - Orchestrate high-level workflows

### üìÅ File Organization Rules

**NEVER save to root folder. Use these directories:**
- `/src` - Source code files
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation and markdown files
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts
- `/examples` - Example code

## üõ°Ô∏è REGRESSION PREVENTION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

### Critical Bug Fix Requirements

**ALL bug fixes MUST follow this protocol to prevent regression:**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Comprehensive Search Before Fix
- NEVER fix based on first few grep results
- ALWAYS search with multiple patterns and variations
- Create complete inventory BEFORE starting fixes
- Use memory to track all found instances

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verification-First Development  
- Write failing test FIRST
- Test must simulate production environment
- Clear all caches before testing
- Only claim success when test passes

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Progress Tracking
- Use memory namespaces: fixes/{issue}/inventory
- Track: total-found, attempted, completed, verified
- Block success claims without 100% completion

### üîç Comprehensive Search Protocol

**MANDATORY SEARCH PATTERNS FOR ALL BUG FIXES:**

```bash
# Phase 1: Multi-Pattern Search (REQUIRED)
comprehensive_search() {
    local issue="$1"
    local pattern="$2"
    
    echo "üîç Comprehensive Search Protocol for: $issue"
    
    # Search with all variations
    patterns=("$pattern" "${pattern,,}" "${pattern^^}" "${pattern^}")
    file_types=("*.html" "*.js" "*.css" "*.md" "*.tsx" "*.ts" "*.json" "*.yaml" "*.yml")
    
    # Create complete inventory
    find . -type f \( ${file_types[@]/#/-name } \) | \
    xargs grep -l -E "(${patterns[0]}|${patterns[1]}|${patterns[2]}|${patterns[3]})" > /tmp/fix_inventory_$issue.txt
    
    local count=$(wc -l < /tmp/fix_inventory_$issue.txt)
    echo "üìã Found $count files requiring fixes"
    
    # Store in memory
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store --key "fixes/$issue/total-found" --value "$count"
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store --key "fixes/$issue/inventory" --value "$(cat /tmp/fix_inventory_$issue.txt)"
    
    if [ "$count" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: No files found - pattern might be incorrect"
        return 1
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ Comprehensive search complete: $count files identified"
    return 0
}
```

### üß™ Verification-First Development Protocol

**MANDATORY TEST CREATION BEFORE ANY FIX:**

```bash
# Phase 2: Create Failing Test (REQUIRED)
create_verification_test() {
    local issue="$1"
    local description="$2"
    
    echo "üß™ Creating verification test for: $issue"
    
    # Test script must fail before fix
    cat > /tmp/verify_test_$issue.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Production build test
echo "üèóÔ∏è Testing production build..."
hugo --environment production --minify

# Additional validation can go here
echo "‚úÖ Production build successful"
EOF

    chmod +x /tmp/verify_test_$issue.sh
    
    # Test MUST fail before fix
    if /tmp/verify_test_$issue.sh; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Test passed - issue might already be fixed or test incorrect"
        echo "üîç Please verify the issue exists and test is correct"
        return 1
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ Verification test fails as expected - ready to proceed with fix"
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store --key "fixes/$issue/test-created" --value "true"
    return 0
}
```

### üìä Progress Tracking Protocol

**MANDATORY PROGRESS TRACKING:**

```bash
# Phase 3: Track Fix Progress (REQUIRED)
track_fix_progress() {
    local issue="$1"
    local file="$2"
    local status="$3"  # attempted|completed|verified
    
    # Update progress counters
    local current=$(npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-retrieve --key "fixes/$issue/$status" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    local new_count=$((current + 1))
    
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store --key "fixes/$issue/$status" --value "$new_count"
    
    # Store file-specific progress
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store --key "fixes/$issue/files/$file" --value "$status"
    
    echo "üìä Progress Update: $file marked as $status"
}

# Validation before claiming success
validate_fix_completion() {
    local issue="$1"
    
    local total=$(npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-retrieve --key "fixes/$issue/total-found")
    local verified=$(npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-retrieve --key "fixes/$issue/verified" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    
    if [ "$verified" != "$total" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Cannot claim success"
        echo "üìä Progress: $verified/$total files verified"
        echo "üö´ Must fix ALL files before claiming success"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Final verification test
    if ! /tmp/verify_test_$issue.sh; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Final verification test failed"
        return 1
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ All fixes verified successfully: $total/$total"
    return 0
}
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Regression Memory System

**Memory namespace patterns for tracking fixes:**

```bash
# Anti-regression memory organization
fixes/{issue_type}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ total-found              # Total files requiring fixes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inventory                 # Complete list of affected files  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ attempted                 # Number of files fix was attempted on
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ completed                 # Number of files fix was completed on
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ verified                  # Number of files where fix was verified
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-created             # Whether verification test was created
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-passed              # Whether final test passed
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ files/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file1.html           # Status: attempted|completed|verified
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file2.js             # Status: attempted|completed|verified
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## üõ°Ô∏è ANTI-DUPLICATION ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM

### üö´ CRITICAL: FILE DUPLICATION PREVENTION

**ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY**: Creating duplicate files is the #1 anti-pattern that creates maintenance burden and technical debt.

#### Forbidden Duplication Patterns
```bash
# ‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN PATTERNS:
existing_file.py + existing_file_refactored.py
service.py + service_refactored.py
component.tsx + component_new.tsx
utils.js + utils_updated.js
config.json + config_v2.json
README.md + README_new.md

# ‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH: ALWAYS EDIT EXISTING FILES
# Use Edit/MultiEdit tools to modify existing files directly
Edit(existing_file.py, old_content, new_content)
MultiEdit(existing_file.py, [{old_string, new_string}, ...])
```

### üìã MANDATORY VALIDATION PROTOCOL

**ALL agents MUST follow this validation sequence:**

#### Phase 1: Pre-Creation Validation (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Step 1: Search for existing similar files
claude-context search "[filename_root]" --path "." --limit 20

# Step 2: Check for existing variations
find . -name "*[base_name]*" -type f | grep -E "\.(py|js|ts|tsx|md|json)$"

# Step 3: Validate Edit vs Write tool usage
if [[ -f "$TARGET_FILE" ]]; then
  echo "üö´ DUPLICATION BLOCKED: File exists, MUST use Edit tools"
  echo "‚úÖ CORRECT ACTION: Edit('$TARGET_FILE', old_content, new_content)"
  exit 1
fi

# Step 4: Memory-based duplication tracking
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-search --pattern "files/created/*" --key "*$BASE_NAME*"
```

#### Phase 2: During-Work Validation (ENFORCED)
```bash
# Continuous monitoring during file operations
validate_file_operation() {
  local operation="$1"
  local file_path="$2"

  if [[ "$operation" == "Write" && -f "$file_path" ]]; then
    echo "üö® DUPLICATION VIOLATION: Attempting to Write existing file"
    echo "üõë BLOCKED: Use Edit tools for existing files"
    echo "üìù REQUIRED: Edit('$file_path', old_content, new_content)"
    return 1
  fi

  # Check for suffix patterns
  if echo "$file_path" | grep -E "_(refactored|new|updated|v[0-9]|copy|backup)\."; then
    echo "üö® SUFFIX VIOLATION: Forbidden file suffix detected"
    echo "üõë BLOCKED: Never create files with suffixes like _refactored, _new, etc."
    return 1
  fi
}
```

#### Phase 3: Post-Task Validation (AUTOMATIC)
```bash
# Automatic duplication detection after task completion
post_task_duplication_scan() {
  echo "üîç Scanning for accidental duplications..."

  # Find potential duplicates by similar names
  find . -type f -name "*.*" | \
  sed 's/\.[^.]*$//' | \
  sort | uniq -d | while read base; do
    duplicates=$(find . -name "${base}*" -type f)
    if [ $(echo "$duplicates" | wc -l) -gt 1 ]; then
      echo "üö® DUPLICATION DETECTED: $duplicates"
      echo "üõ†Ô∏è REQUIRED ACTION: Consolidate or remove duplicates"
    fi
  done
}
```

## Project Overview

This project uses SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology with Claude-Flow orchestration for systematic Test-Driven Development.

## SPARC Commands

### Core Commands
- `npx claude-flow sparc modes` - List available modes
- `npx claude-flow sparc run <mode> "<task>"` - Execute specific mode
- `npx claude-flow sparc tdd "<feature>"` - Run complete TDD workflow
- `npx claude-flow sparc info <mode>` - Get mode details

### Batchtools Commands
- `npx claude-flow sparc batch <modes> "<task>"` - Parallel execution
- `npx claude-flow sparc pipeline "<task>"` - Full pipeline processing
- `npx claude-flow sparc concurrent <mode> "<tasks-file>"` - Multi-task processing

### Build Commands
- `npm run build` - Build project
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Linting
- `npm run typecheck` - Type checking

## SPARC Workflow Phases

1. **Specification** - Requirements analysis (`sparc run spec-pseudocode`)
2. **Pseudocode** - Algorithm design (`sparc run spec-pseudocode`)
3. **Architecture** - System design (`sparc run architect`)
4. **Refinement** - TDD implementation (`sparc tdd`)
5. **Completion** - Integration (`sparc run integration`)

## Code Style & Best Practices

- **Modular Design**: Files under 500 lines
- **Environment Safety**: Never hardcode secrets
- **Test-First**: Write tests before implementation
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns
- **Documentation**: Keep updated

## üöÄ Available Agents (54 Total) + Agile Roles

### üèÉ Agile-Specific Agents
`product-owner`, `scrum-master`, `hugo-developer`, `content-developer`, `agile-coordinator`

### Core Development
`coder`, `reviewer`, `tester`, `planner`, `researcher`

**CRITICAL**: All agents MUST use generic names without project prefixes. Use `coordinator` NOT `jt-coordinator`.

### Swarm Coordination
`hierarchical-coordinator`, `mesh-coordinator`, `adaptive-coordinator`, `collective-intelligence-coordinator`, `swarm-memory-manager`

### Consensus & Distributed
`byzantine-coordinator`, `raft-manager`, `gossip-coordinator`, `consensus-builder`, `crdt-synchronizer`, `quorum-manager`, `security-manager`

### Performance & Optimization
`perf-analyzer`, `performance-benchmarker`, `task-orchestrator`, `memory-coordinator`, `smart-agent`

### GitHub & Repository
`github-modes`, `pr-manager`, `code-review-swarm`, `issue-tracker`, `release-manager`, `workflow-automation`, `project-board-sync`, `repo-architect`, `multi-repo-swarm`

### Testing & Validation
`tdd-london-swarm`, `production-validator`

### Migration & Planning
`migration-planner`, `swarm-init`

## üéØ Claude Code vs MCP Tools

### Claude Code Handles ALL EXECUTION:
- **Task tool**: Spawn and run agents concurrently for actual work
- File operations (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep)
- Code generation and programming
- Bash commands and system operations
- Implementation work
- Project navigation and analysis
- TodoWrite and task management
- Git operations
- Package management
- Testing and debugging

### MCP Tools ONLY COORDINATE:
- Swarm initialization (topology setup)
- Agent type definitions (coordination patterns)
- Task orchestration (high-level planning)
- Memory management
- Neural features
- Performance tracking
- GitHub integration

**KEY**: MCP coordinates the strategy, Claude Code's Task tool executes with real agents.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

```bash
# Add Claude Flow MCP server
claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start
```

## MCP Tool Categories

### Coordination
`swarm_init`, `agent_spawn`, `task_orchestrate`

### Monitoring
`swarm_status`, `agent_list`, `agent_metrics`, `task_status`, `task_results`

### Memory & Neural
`memory_usage`, `neural_status`, `neural_train`, `neural_patterns`

### GitHub Integration
`github_swarm`, `repo_analyze`, `pr_enhance`, `issue_triage`, `code_review`

### System
`benchmark_run`, `features_detect`, `swarm_monitor`

## üöÄ Agent Execution Flow with Claude Code

### The Correct Pattern:

1. **Optional**: Use MCP tools to set up coordination topology
2. **REQUIRED**: Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn agents that do actual work
3. **REQUIRED**: Each agent runs hooks for coordination
4. **REQUIRED**: Batch all operations in single messages

### Example Full-Stack Development:

```
// Single message with all agent spawning via Claude Code's Task tool
[Parallel Agent Execution]:
  Task("Backend Developer", "Build REST API with Express. Use hooks for coordination.", "backend-dev")
  Task("Frontend Developer", "Create React UI. Coordinate with backend via memory.", "coder")
  Task("Database Architect", "Design PostgreSQL schema. Store schema in memory.", "code-analyzer")
  Task("Test Engineer", "Write Jest tests. Check memory for API contracts.", "tester")
  Task("DevOps Engineer", "Setup Docker and CI/CD. Document in memory.", "cicd-engineer")
  Task("Security Auditor", "Review authentication. Report findings via hooks.", "reviewer")

  // All todos batched together
  TodoWrite { todos: [...8-10 todos...] }

  // All file operations together
  Write "backend/server.js"
  Write "frontend/App.jsx"
  Write "database/schema.sql"
```

## üöÄ Enhanced Agent Capabilities with Quality Framework

### Cross-Agent Coordination Protocols

**Enhanced agent coordination includes quality framework integration:**

```yaml
enhanced_agent_capabilities:
  quality_framework_integration: true
  zero_defect_methodology: required
  prevention_first_coordination: true
  consistency_pattern_enforcement: true
  technical_debt_prevention: mandatory

cross_agent_memory_patterns:
  quality_validation_results: "quality/*/validation/*"
  prevention_methodology_state: "quality/*/prevention/*" 
  consistency_patterns: "quality/*/consistency/*"
  debt_elimination_tracking: "quality/*/technical-debt/*"
  content_quality_validation: "quality/*/content-quality/*"
  performance_optimization: "quality/*/performance/*"
```

### Quality-Enhanced Agent Enhancement References

**ALL Hugo site development agents MUST reference these enhanced capabilities:**

- **Enhanced Quality-Driven Development**: Zero-defect philosophy integration for site quality
- **Prevention-First Coordination**: Proactive quality issue prevention in content and code
- **Consistency Pattern Validation**: Automated pattern compliance checking for site consistency
- **Technical Debt Elimination**: Real-time debt detection and resolution in site architecture

## üö® BUG FIX ENFORCEMENT RULES (ZERO TOLERANCE)

### AUTOMATIC FAILURE CONDITIONS (BLOCKING)

**Agents will be IMMEDIATELY BLOCKED and marked as FAILED if they:**

1. **üö´ CLAIM FIX WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH**
   - Fixing based on `head -5` or partial results
   - Not checking all file types and variations
   - Missing files from inventory
   - Not using claude-context for search
   - **AUTOMATIC FAILURE**: Agent blocked from continuing

2. **üö´ TEST WITH CACHE PRESENT**
   - Not clearing resources/_gen before testing
   - Using cached build results
   - Testing different environment than production
   - Not running bin/test for verification
   - **AUTOMATIC FAILURE**: Agent blocked from continuing

3. **üö´ INCOMPLETE PROGRESS TRACKING**
   - Not using memory to track fixes
   - Claiming success with partial completion
   - No verification test created
   - Not running bin/test after each change
   - **AUTOMATIC FAILURE**: Agent blocked from continuing

4. **üö´ BYPASS TEST VALIDATION (NEW)**
   - Starting work without running bin/test first
   - Making changes without running bin/test after each
   - Claiming completion without ALL tests passing
   - Deleting or commenting out tests to make them "pass"
   - **AUTOMATIC FAILURE**: Agent immediately suspended

### Bug Fix Agent Protocol

**When spawning agents for bug fixes, ALWAYS include:**

```javascript
Task("Bug Fixer", `
  üö® MANDATORY BUG FIX PROTOCOL - ZERO TOLERANCE:
  
  üõë PRE-FIX BLOCKING VALIDATION:
  - MUST run bin/test FIRST - BLOCKED if fails
  - Cannot start fix work until tests pass
  
  1. üö® COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH (BLOCKING):
     - MUST use claude-context search (NOT grep/find)
     - MUST search ALL file types with ALL pattern variations
     - MUST create complete inventory before starting ANY fixes
     - MUST store inventory: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store --key "fixes/[ISSUE]/inventory"
     - BLOCKED from starting fixes without complete inventory
  
  2. üö® VERIFICATION FIRST (BLOCKING):
     - MUST write test that FAILS before any fix
     - BLOCKED from proceeding if test doesn't fail correctly
     - MUST run bin/test after creating reproduction test
  
  3. üö® TRACK PROGRESS WITH TEST ENFORCEMENT:
     - MUST run bin/test after EACH file fixed
     - AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK: git checkout -- . if bin/test fails
     - MUST update memory after EACH file: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store
     - MUST track: attempted, completed, verified WITH test results
     - BLOCKED from claiming success until 100% verified
  
  4. üö® FINAL VALIDATION (BLOCKING COMPLETION):
     - MUST run reproduction test - should now PASS
     - MUST run bin/test - ALL tests must pass
     - MUST verify bin/dtest works
     - MUST verify bin/build works
     - MUST verify bin/dev works
     - MUST check all files in inventory are fixed
     - MUST verify with empty cache
  
  üö´ BLOCKED FROM CLAIMING SUCCESS WITHOUT:
  ‚úì Complete inventory of ALL affected files
  ‚úì Reproduction test passing
  ‚úì bin/build working
  ‚úì bin/dev working  
  ‚úì bin/test passing (ALL tests)
  ‚úì bin/dtest passing (ALL tests)
  ‚úì Verification with empty cache
  
  ZERO TOLERANCE: No exceptions, no shortcuts, no bypass
`, "coder")
```

### Memory Enforcement

**Check before allowing success claim:**

```bash
# Pre-success validation hook
validate_bug_fix_success() {
    local issue="$1"
    
    # üö® MANDATORY: Check comprehensive search was done
    local total=$(npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-retrieve --key "fixes/$issue/total-found" 2>/dev/null)

        return 1
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ All validation gates passed - success claim approved"
    return 0
}
```

### MANDATORY Test Deletion Prevention (ZERO TOLERANCE)

**BLOCKING: Agents CANNOT delete or disable tests:**

```bash
# Pre-commit hook to prevent test deletion
prevent_test_deletion() {
    echo "üõ°Ô∏è ZERO TOLERANCE: Test deletion prevention"
    
    # Check for deleted test files
    local deleted_tests=$(git diff --cached --name-status | grep '^D.*\.\(test\|spec\)\.')
    
    if [ -n "$deleted_tests" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Test file deletion detected"
        echo "üö´ FORBIDDEN: Cannot delete test files to make tests pass"

  - MUST run bin/test - BLOCKED if fails
  - Cannot begin work until tests pass
  
  üö® DURING WORK:
  - MUST run bin/test after EVERY file change
  - AUTOMATIC rollback: git checkout -- . on failure
  - Cannot proceed until tests pass
  
  üö® BEFORE COMPLETION:
  - MUST run full test suite: bin/dtest
  - MUST verify build works: bin/build
  - BLOCKED from claiming done if ANY test fails
  
  ZERO TOLERANCE: No exceptions, no bypass, no excuses.

```

### MEMORY TRACKING ENFORCEMENT

**Track test validation status for ALL agents:**

```bash
# Store test validation results
store_test_validation_result() {
    local agent_name="$1"
    local phase="$2"  # pre-task, during-task, post-task
    local result="$3" # passed, failed, blocked
    local task_id="$4"
    
    npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store \
      --key "test-validation/$task_id/$agent_name/$phase" \
      --value "result:$result,timestamp:$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
      --namespace "test-enforcement"
    
    if [ "$result" = "failed" ]; then
        echo "üö® TEST VALIDATION FAILURE RECORDED"
        echo "üìä Agent: $agent_name, Phase: $phase, Task: $task_id"
        
        # Increment failure counter
        local failures=$(npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-retrieve \
          --key "test-validation/failures/$agent_name" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
        local new_failures=$((failures + 1))
        
        npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-store \
          --key "test-validation/failures/$agent_name" \
          --value "$new_failures" \
          --namespace "test-enforcement"
        
        if [ "$new_failures" -ge 3 ]; then
            echo "üîí AGENT SUSPENDED: Too many test validation failures"
            echo "üìã Required: Review and retraining before resuming work"
        fi
    fi
}
```

### TEST DELETION PREVENTION (ZERO TOLERANCE)

```bash
# BLOCKING: Prevent deletion of valid tests
prevent_test_deletion() {
    echo "üõ°Ô∏è ZERO TOLERANCE: Preventing test deletion"
    
    # Check for deleted test files in git diff
    local deleted_tests=$(git diff --name-status | grep '^D.*\.test\.')
    
    if [ -n "$deleted_tests" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Test file deletion detected"
        echo "üö´ FORBIDDEN: Cannot delete test files to make tests pass"
        echo "üìã Deleted tests:"
        echo "$deleted_tests"
        echo ""
        echo "üîÑ REQUIRED ACTION: git checkout -- [test_files]"
        echo "üõ†Ô∏è ALTERNATIVE: Fix the code, not delete the tests"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Check for commented out test cases
    local commented_tests=$(find . -name "*.test.*" -exec grep -l "// .*it(\|// .*describe(\|/\* .*it(\|/\* .*describe(" {} \;)
    
    if [ -n "$commented_tests" ]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Commented test cases detected"
        echo "üîç Files with commented tests:"
        echo "$commented_tests"
        echo "üõ†Ô∏è REQUIRED: Fix failing tests instead of commenting them out"
    fi
}
```

### REGRESSION PREVENTION INTEGRATION

**Enhanced verification-first with test enforcement:**

```bash
# Comprehensive fix protocol with test enforcement
fix_with_test_enforcement() {
    local issue="$1"
    
    echo "üîß Fix with mandatory test enforcement for: $issue"
    
    # Step 1: Pre-fix test validation (MANDATORY)
    if ! pre_task_test_validation; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Cannot start fix - tests already failing"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Step 2: Create reproduction test (MANDATORY)
    if ! create_reproduction_test "$issue"; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Cannot proceed without reproduction test"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Step 3: Comprehensive search with test safety
    comprehensive_search "$issue"
    
    # Step 4: Fix files with test validation after each
    while read -r file; do
        echo "üîß Fixing: $file"
        
        # Apply fix
        apply_fix "$file" "$issue"
        
        # MANDATORY: Test after each fix
        if ! during_task_test_validation "$file"; then
            echo "‚ùå Fix broke tests - already rolled back"
            exit 1
        fi
        
        echo "‚úÖ Fixed and validated: $file"
    done < "/tmp/fix_inventory_$issue.txt"
    
    # Step 5: Final validation (MANDATORY)
    if ! post_task_test_validation "fix-$issue"; then
        echo "‚ùå BLOCKED: Fix incomplete - tests still failing"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ Fix complete with all tests passing"
}
```

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
Never save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder.
- always spawn swarm to handle requests
- üö® MANDATORY: After each task spawn appropriate agent to run bin/test with ZERO TOLERANCE - all tests MUST pass
- üö® BLOCKING: If bin/test fails, agent is BLOCKED from continuing until tests pass
- üö® AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK: Any change that breaks tests triggers immediate git checkout -- .
- üõ°Ô∏è FORBIDDEN: Deletion of valid tests to make them pass - reviewer pre-validation MANDATORY
- üìä TRACKED: All test validation results stored in memory for compliance monitoring
- prioritize to use claude-context for search through codebase over average search
- verify tests after each change and request to rework on found issues
- prevent deletion of valid tests to make them pass. IMPORTANT: pre-validate changes with reviewer to avoid breaking changes
- spawn swarm: prevent deletion of valid tests to make them pass. IMPORTANT: pre-validate changes with reviewer to avoid breaking changes
- always activate weekly iteration/incremental development work for significant requests, and schedule reflections at the end of each iteration.
- üö® ZERO TOLERANCE: bin/test, bin/dev, bin/build, bin/dtest MUST work after changes - fix or revert immediately!
- Focus on one iteration at a time. WIP: 1 milestone, 1 sprint (2 weeks), 1 active iteration (1 week), limited job stories per iteration
- Use micro-refactoring (3-line changes) as a QUALITY TECHNIQUE within iteration development, not as iteration definition
- do not left one time verification scripts just to test one regression, or it should be minitests or it should be removed after task completed
- do not add custom scripts hooks for agents and use only native claude and caude-flow npx invocations.

## üö® CRITICAL FAILURE PREVENTION SAFEGUARDS

### üõ°Ô∏è REFACTORING SAFEGUARD (ZERO TOLERANCE)
- üö® BLOCKING: NEVER accept broken functionality as "solution" when task is refactoring
- üõ°Ô∏è REFACTORING RULE: Must maintain EXACT same functionality while fixing issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING SIGNS: If changing test baselines/expectations, you're breaking not refactoring
- ‚úÖ VALIDATION: Original functionality preserved + issue fixed = successful refactoring
- ‚ùå VIOLATION: Accepting different output/behavior violates refactoring requirement

### üîí BRANCH SAFETY PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)  
- üö® BLOCKING: NEVER use git stash + git checkout without explicit preservation plan
- üõ°Ô∏è SAFE BRANCH SWITCHING: Always commit or create explicit backup before switching
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING SIGNS: Using git stash means risking work loss
- ‚úÖ VALIDATION: Work preserved through commits or explicit user-approved backup strategy
- ‚ùå VIOLATION: Any git operation that risks losing uncommitted work

### üìã REQUIREMENT COMPLIANCE VALIDATION
- üö® MANDATORY: Before accepting any solution, verify it meets original requirements
- üõ°Ô∏è COMPLIANCE CHECK: "Does this maintain the original request parameters?"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ESCALATION: If cannot fix within requirements, escalate rather than violate
- ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA: Original requirements met + issue resolved
- ‚ùå FAILURE PATTERN: Changing requirements to fit solution instead of fixing solution
- For hugo code use hugo idiomatic way; for ruby use ruby, minitest and rails idiomatic ways
