**Source Location**: `docs/projects/jt-site/`
**Destination**: `docs/projects/2509-css-migration/35-39-project-management/`

1. **kanban.md** ‚Üí **35.01-sprint-kanban-board.md**
   - AC.ID: 35.01
   - Di√°taxis Type: Reference (operational sprint tracking)
   - Purpose: Operational sprint board with WIP limits

   - Purpose: Business goal ‚Üí Actor impacts ‚Üí Deliverables mapping

3. **user-story-map.md** ‚Üí **35.03-user-story-map.md**
   - AC.ID: 35.03

## üìä Rationale for Strategy: Keep Separate with Cross-References

### Analysis Summary

**Content Overlap Assessment**:
- ‚ùå **NO duplication detected** - Content is complementary
- ‚úÖ **Different perspectives** on the SAME project
- ‚úÖ **Different audiences**: Technical execution vs. Business/Product planning
- ‚úÖ **Different update cadence**: Daily/Sprint vs. Release cycles

**Existing Documentation** (2509-css-migration/):
- **GOAL-AND-PROGRESS.md** - Technical sprint progress, handbook compliance
- **PROJECT-SUMMARY.md** - Phase completion, readiness assessment
- **REMAINING-WORK-TO-FINAL-GOAL.md** - Detailed 4-phase technical backlog (9,072 items)
- **30-39-documentation/** - Sprint planning, roadmaps, daily metrics

**New Tracking Files** (now 35-39-project-management/):
- **35.01-sprint-kanban-board.md** - Operational task board (WIP limits enforcement)
- **35.02-impact-map.md** - Business value traceability (NO equivalent in existing docs)
- **35.03-user-story-map.md** - User-centric story organization (extends existing task lists)

### Key Insight

The new tracking files provide **DIFFERENT perspectives** on the SAME project:
- **Existing docs**: Technical execution focus (sprints, tasks, handbook compliance)
- **New tracking**: Business value + user journey focus (impacts, stories, releases)

This is **NOT duplication** - it's **complementary multi-perspective tracking** supporting different stakeholder needs.

## üìã Alternatives Considered

### ‚ùå Option A: Move to 2509-css-migration/ root
**Rejected because**:
- Would clutter root level with operational docs

- Mixes strategic and operational documents

### ‚ùå Option C: Merge content into existing files
**Rejected because**:
- Would create massive documents (>1000 lines)
- Would mix different perspectives (technical vs. business)
- Would serve different stakeholders poorly
- Would violate single responsibility principle

### ‚úÖ Option B: Keep Separate with Enhanced Cross-References (CHOSEN)
**Selected because**:
- Maintains clear separation of concerns
- Supports different stakeholder needs
- Johnny Decimal compliant
- Zero duplication through cross-references
- Flexible update cadences preserved
