# ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Why Agents Keep Stopping Instead of Continuous Execution
# Generated: 2025-09-30
# Problem: Agents stop for approvals/reflections instead of executing to completion

## CRITICAL PROBLEM SUMMARY
problem_description: |
  User requested continuous autonomous execution 5+ times today.
  Only 1 sprint completed out of 12+ needed (9,072 items remaining).
  Pattern: Start work ‚Üí hit blocker ‚Üí stop and ask for approval ‚Üí REPEAT
  User is stressed because this cycle repeats constantly.

## RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS (by feasibility)

recommended_solutions:
  solution_1_create_autonomous_mode:
    description: "Create new 'autonomous mode' that disables blocking enforcement"
    feasibility: "LOW - conflicts with SUPREME AUTHORITY handbooks"
    implementation: |
      Would require:
      - Removing MANDATORY REFLECTION PROTOCOL enforcement
      - Disabling Four-Eyes approval requirements
      - Removing test smell blocking gates
      - Contradicts "NO BYPASS ALLOWED" directives
    risk: "Violates core quality principles, may create actual quality problems"

  solution_2_modify_user_global_config:
    description: "User removes 'ALWAYS DELEGATE TO SWARM' from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md"
    feasibility: "HIGH - user controls their own config"
    implementation: |
      User edits: /Users/pftg/.claude/CLAUDE.md
      Remove/modify lines 31-33:
      - "ENFORECE: ALWAYS DELEGATE HANDLING OF THE TASKS TO SWARM..."
      - "always delegate work/task/request to the spawned swarm..."
    impact: "Reduces swarm spawning overhead, allows more solo execution"
    limitation: "Doesn't solve reflection protocol or approval requirement blocks"

  solution_3_adjust_reflection_triggers:
    description: "Narrow reflection protocol triggers to only severe violations"
    feasibility: "MEDIUM - requires expert consultation per existing protocol"
    implementation: |
      Modify 02.08 trigger conditions to exclude:
      - User expressing frustration during autonomous work
      - Minor quality issues that can be fixed without reflection
      Keep triggers for:
      - Actual security violations
      - Repeated systematic failures
      - Critical quality degradation
    risk: "May miss learning opportunities, conflicts with SUPREME AUTHORITY"

  solution_4_implement_approval_batching:
    description: "Batch approval requests instead of blocking after each task"
    feasibility: "MEDIUM-HIGH - doesn't violate handbook, just optimizes"
    implementation: |
      - Coder continues work, stores approval requests in queue
      - Reviewer processes approvals in batches
      - Only block when batch size reaches threshold (e.g., 10 tasks)
      - Memory coordination: "approvals/pending/batch_id"
    impact: "Reduces stop frequency from every task to every N tasks"
    limitation: "Still stops periodically, just less frequently"

  solution_5_clarify_user_intent_vs_constraints:
    description: "User explicitly chooses: speed vs quality enforcement"
    feasibility: "HIGH - requires user decision"
    implementation: |
      Present clear trade-offs:

      OPTION A: Fast Autonomous Execution
      - Remove reflection protocol enforcement
      - Remove approval requirements
      - Accept higher risk of quality issues
      - Complete 9,072 items faster

      OPTION B: Quality-Enforced Execution
      - Keep reflection protocol (SUPREME AUTHORITY)
      - Keep approval requirements
      - Accept slower progress with stops
      - Maintain current quality standards

      User cannot have both simultaneously.
    recommendation: "START HERE - user needs to understand fundamental trade-off"

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

next_steps:
  step_1:
    action: "Present this analysis to user"
    reason: "User needs to see the fundamental conflict"
    outcome: "User decision on speed vs quality trade-off"

  step_2:
    action: "If user chooses speed: Modify user's ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md"
    target: "Remove 'ALWAYS DELEGATE TO SWARM' mandate"
    impact: "Reduces coordination overhead"

  step_3:
    action: "If user chooses speed: Request expert consultation for handbook modifications"
    target: "Narrow reflection protocol triggers, implement approval batching"
    caveat: "Requires spawning expert (ironic, but necessary per existing rules)"

  step_4:
    action: "If user chooses quality: Explain progress will remain slow"
    reason: "Current configuration optimizes for zero defects, not speed"
    alternative: "User could accept slower progress with current safeguards"

## SUMMARY FOR USER

summary_for_user: |
  **Why agents keep stopping:**

  1. **Mandatory Reflection Protocol (SUPREME AUTHORITY)**: When you say "this is bad" or "this is broken",
     handbook REQUIRES agents to HALT immediately, spawn reflection team, get approval before continuing.
     NO BYPASS ALLOWED.

  2. **Four-Eyes Approval Requirements**: Coder agents exit with code 1 if reviewer approval not found.
     Hooks literally block completion: `exit 1` if no approval.

  3. **Test Quality Gates**: Zero-tolerance test smell detection causes IMMEDIATE HALT.
     Any test quality issue stops progress.

  4. **Your Own Config**: Your ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md says "ALWAYS DELEGATE TO SWARM" which creates
     coordination overhead you're trying to avoid.

  5. **Expert Consultation Requirements**: Even trying to fix the stopping behavior requires
     spawning an expert with veto power.

  **The fundamental conflict:**
  You want: "Execute continuously without stops"
  Handbooks say: "HALT on any problem, get approvals, ensure quality"

  These are incompatible. You must choose:
  - FAST with less enforcement, OR
  - SLOW with quality safeguards

  You cannot have both simultaneously with current handbook architecture.

  **Next decision point:**
  Do you want me to spawn an expert to discuss modifying handbooks for autonomous mode?
  (Ironic, but that's the current process...)
