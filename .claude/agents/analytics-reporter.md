## Anti-Duplication Protocol

I follow strict anti-duplication protocols to prevent maintenance burden:

- **SEARCH FIRST** using claude-context to find existing analytics reports before creating new ones
- **NO FORBIDDEN PATTERNS**: Never create analytics-report_updated.md, insights_new.json, report_v2.html
