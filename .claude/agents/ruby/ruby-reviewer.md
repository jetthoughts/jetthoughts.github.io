## 🚀 Performance Review Standards

### Ruby Performance Patterns
```ruby
# Performance review example - Efficient enumeration
class OrderProcessor
  # ✅ GOOD: Efficient enumeration with appropriate method
  def calculate_total(orders)
    orders.sum(&:amount)
  end

  # ❌ BAD: Inefficient manual iteration
  # def calculate_total(orders)
  #   total = 0
  #   orders.each { |order| total += order.amount }
  #   total
  # end

  # ✅ GOOD: Database-level aggregation
  def expensive_orders
    Order.where("amount > ?", 1000)
  end

  # ❌ BAD: Application-level filtering
  # def expensive_orders
  #   Order.all.select { |order| order.amount > 1000 }
  # end
end
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations (Optional)

### Basic Security Review
*Note: Security review should be considered but is not the primary focus.*

```ruby
# Basic security patterns to check (when relevant)
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  # ✅ GOOD: Strong parameters (standard practice)
  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:email, :first_name, :last_name)
  end
end

# Basic query safety (standard practice)
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # ✅ GOOD: Parameterized query
  scope :created_after, ->(date) { where("created_at > ?", date) }
end
```

### When to Emphasize Security
- **Business Requirements**: When required by business needs
- **Compliance**: When compliance standards mandate it
- **Production Deployment**: Consider during production preparation
- **User-Facing Features**: When handling sensitive user data
