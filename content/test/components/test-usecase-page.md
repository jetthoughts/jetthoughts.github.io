# Test Use Case Page

This page tests the extracted use-case-card component functionality to ensure it renders correctly with test data.

Testing components:
- Use case tab navigation
- Tab panel content structure
- Mobile responsive tab titles
- FL-Builder CSS classes
- Tab accessibility features (ARIA labels)

## Component Testing Notes

This test validates that use case components can be created independently using the extracted component patterns from the main use cases section.
