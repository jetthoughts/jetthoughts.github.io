# Test Testimonials Page

This page tests the extracted testimonial component functionality to ensure it renders correctly with real testimonial data.

Testing components:
- Testimonial slider/swiper functionality
- Badge display and loading
- Rating system and star graphics
- Testimonial card layouts
- Swiper navigation and responsive behavior
- CSS loading optimization

## Component Testing Notes

This test validates that testimonial components can be created independently using the extracted component patterns and work correctly with actual testimonial data structures.
