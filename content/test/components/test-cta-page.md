# Test CTA Blocks Page

This page tests the extracted CTA (Call-to-Action) block component functionality to ensure it renders correctly with test data in different contexts.

Testing components:
- Primary CTA buttons
- Secondary CTA buttons
- CTA block layouts
- Button styling and hover effects
- Responsive CTA positioning
- Different CTA contexts and use cases

## Component Testing Notes

This test validates that CTA blocks can be created independently using the extracted component patterns and work correctly in various page contexts.
