# Test Service Page

This page tests the extracted service-card component functionality to ensure it renders correctly with test data.

Testing components:
- Service card layout structure
- FL-Builder CSS classes
- Icon integration
- Call-to-action buttons
- Responsive design

## Component Testing Notes

This test validates that service cards can be created independently using the extracted component patterns from the main services page.
