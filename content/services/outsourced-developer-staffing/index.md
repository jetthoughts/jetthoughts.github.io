  - question: "How quickly can you provide developers for our project?"

  - question: "What's the difference between outsourced staffing and hiring full-time developers?"
    answer: "Outsourced developer staffing eliminates recruiting, training, payroll, and HR administration costs. You get immediate access to pre-vetted talent without long hiring processes, onboarding time, or administrative overhead. You can scale up or down based on project needs without long-term commitments."

    answer: "We provide full-stack developers, Ruby on Rails specialists, React and frontend developers, mobile developers (iOS/Android), DevOps engineers, QA engineers, and UI/UX designers. All developers have 3+ years of experience and are vetted for both technical skills and communication abilities."
  - question: "How do you ensure quality and communication?"
    answer: "All our developers go through rigorous technical vetting, English proficiency testing, and cultural fit assessment. They follow agile development practices, provide regular progress updates, participate in daily standups, and integrate seamlessly with your existing team and workflows."
  - question: "What's included in your fully-managed staffing service?"
    answer: "Our service includes developer sourcing and vetting, skills assessment and matching, onboarding and training, project management oversight, performance monitoring, payroll and benefits administration, and ongoing support.
