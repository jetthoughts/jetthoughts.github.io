faqs:
  - question: "What technologies do you use for Ruby on Rails development?"
    answer: "We specialize in Ruby on Rails development for robust web applications, combined with React and React Native for frontend and mobile development, PostgreSQL for databases, and modern JavaScript frameworks. Our custom Rails development approach covers both backend APIs and responsive frontend interfaces, ensuring scalable and maintainable Ruby on Rails solutions."
  - question: "How long does it typically take to develop a web application?"
    answer: "Development timelines vary based on complexity and scope. Simple web applications take 4-8 weeks, medium complexity projects require 2-4 months, and enterprise-level applications typically take 4-8 months. We provide detailed project timelines after analyzing your specific requirements during our discovery phase."
  - question: "Do you provide ongoing maintenance and support?"
    answer: "Yes, we offer comprehensive post-launch maintenance including security updates, performance monitoring, feature enhancements, bug fixes, and technical support. Our fully-managed service approach means we handle everything from initial development through long-term maintenance and scaling."
  - question: "What's your development process?"
    answer: "We follow an agile development methodology with regular sprint cycles, continuous integration, and frequent client communication. Our process includes discovery and planning, design and prototyping, iterative development with weekly demos, testing and QA, deployment, and ongoing support."
  - question: "Can you work with our existing team or systems?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We seamlessly integrate with existing development teams, work with legacy systems, and can augment your in-house capabilities. Our team acts as an extension of your organization, adapting to your processes, tools, and communication preferences. If you need to scale your team quickly, our [outsourced developer staffing](/services/outsourced-developer-staffing/) service can provide additional Ruby on Rails developers. We also ensure quality through our comprehensive [software QA testing services](/services/software-qa-cat/) integrated into the development process."
