faqs:
  - question: "What makes JetThoughts different from other Rails development agencies?"
    answer: "JetThoughts delivers 3x faster development with 95% client retention through senior Rails developers (8+ years experience), proven startup expertise (200+ successful projects), and fully-managed service eliminating hiring/management overhead. Unlike agencies with junior developers, our team averages 12+ years Rails experience and provides fractional CTO oversight ensuring strategic alignment with business goals."

  - question: "How quickly can you start Rails development for my project?"
    answer: "We typically start within 48 hours of project approval. Our pre-trained Rails development team eliminates the 6-month recruiting and onboarding timeline required for in-house hiring. Within 2 weeks, you get a fully operational development team with established processes, CI/CD pipelines, and weekly sprint cycles delivering working software."

  - question: "What's the cost comparison between JetThoughts and hiring full-time Rails developers?"
    answer: "Our fully-managed Rails development costs 50% less than in-house hiring. In-house team: $120K-180K per developer plus $30K benefits, 6-month recruiting, management overhead, and equity dilution. JetThoughts: $8K-15K per developer monthly, immediate availability, no recruiting costs, includes project management, QA, and DevOps—all fully managed so you focus on business, not developer supervision."

  - question: "Do you only work on new projects or can you improve existing Rails applications?"
    answer: "We excel at both greenfield development and legacy Rails application modernization. Common scenarios: upgrading Rails versions (Rails 4→7 migrations), refactoring monoliths to microservices, performance optimization (3x faster page loads), adding React frontends to legacy Rails apps, and rescuing stalled projects. Our 13+ years Rails experience covers every Rails version and common legacy challenges."

  - question: "What technologies do you use for modern web application development?"
    answer: "Our proven stack: Ruby on Rails 7+ for backend APIs, React/Next.js for frontend SPAs, PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching, Sidekiq for background jobs, AWS/Heroku/DigitalOcean for cloud deployment, Docker for containerization, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. This battle-tested stack enables rapid development while supporting enterprise-scale growth (10K→1M+ users)."

  - question: "How do you ensure code quality with faster development timelines?"
    answer: "Quality comes from experience, not process overhead. Our senior developers (8+ years) produce high-quality code faster through expertise, not shortcuts. We maintain quality via: automated test coverage (>85%), continuous code review by senior developers, pair programming on complex features, CI/CD catching issues immediately, and fractional CTO architecture oversight. Result: 95% client retention with zero critical post-launch bugs."

  - question: "Can you integrate with our existing systems and team?"
    answer: "Yes, we seamlessly integrate with existing teams, APIs, databases, and legacy systems. Common integrations: third-party APIs (Stripe, Twilio, AWS), legacy databases, authentication systems (OAuth, SAML), and existing DevOps infrastructure. We adapt to your workflows, communication preferences (Slack, email, video), and tools while providing expertise to improve processes. Our [outsourced developer staffing](/services/outsourced-developer-staffing/) augments your team, and [software QA services](/services/software-qa-cat/) ensure integration quality."
