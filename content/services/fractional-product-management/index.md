    - name: The Situation
      value: To deliver a high-quality product in a reasonable time that can exceed customer expectations & beat out competitors, most companies require a product expert. A Chief Product Officer acts as the liaison between customers, business leadership, and technical leadership, aligning the organization around a clear product vision that can satisfy customers while providing the project management oversight to make it a reality.
    - name: The Problems
      value: Unfortunately, the cost of product leadership can be significant and access to this type of experienced technical talent can be very competitive.
