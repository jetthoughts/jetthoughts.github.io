faq:
  headline: Frequently Asked Questions About Custom Rails Development
  questions:
    - question: "What makes custom Rails development different from using pre-built solutions?"
      answer: "Custom Rails development creates applications tailored specifically to your business requirements, workflows, and growth plans. Unlike pre-built solutions that force you to adapt your processes, custom development ensures the software works exactly how your business needs it to. This includes custom data models, unique user interfaces, specialized integrations, and scalable architecture designed for your specific use case and future growth projections."
    - question: "How much does custom Rails development cost and what factors affect pricing?"
      answer: "Custom Rails development typically costs $50,000-$500,000+ depending on complexity, features, and timeline. Key factors include: application complexity and feature count, custom integrations required, user interface sophistication, database architecture needs, third-party service integrations, security and compliance requirements, and ongoing maintenance needs. We provide detailed project estimates after understanding your specific requirements through our discovery process. For startups planning technical budgets, our [startup CTO consulting](/services/startup-cto-consulting/) services include comprehensive cost planning and technical roadmaps."
    - question: "What's the typical timeline for custom Rails development projects?"
      answer: "Most custom Rails development projects take 3-8 months from concept to launch, depending on scope and complexity. Our phased approach includes: 2-4 weeks for discovery and planning, 4-12 weeks for core development and testing, 2-4 weeks for integration and deployment, and ongoing support and iterations. We deliver working software every 2 weeks, allowing for feedback and course corrections throughout the development process."
    - question: "How do you ensure custom Rails applications are secure and scalable?"
      answer: "Our custom Rails development follows security-first principles with encrypted data storage, secure authentication systems, HTTPS implementation, regular security audits, and compliance with industry standards. For scalability, we design modular architecture, optimize database queries, implement caching strategies, use cloud-native deployment, and plan for horizontal scaling from the beginning of development."
    - question: "What ongoing support do you provide after custom Rails development is complete?"
      answer: "We provide comprehensive post-launch support including bug fixes and security updates, performance monitoring and optimization, feature enhancements and additions, Rails framework updates, server maintenance and monitoring, backup and disaster recovery, and technical consulting for business growth. Most clients choose our monthly maintenance plans starting at $2,000/month for ongoing peace of mind. For comprehensive technical leadership, our [fractional CTO services](/services/fractional-cto-services/) provide strategic guidance beyond application maintenance."
