faqs:
  - question: "What types of testing do you perform?"
    answer: "We provide comprehensive testing services including automated testing, manual testing, performance testing, security testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), regression testing, and integration testing. Our approach covers both functional and non-functional testing requirements to ensure your software meets quality standards."
  - question: "How does automated testing save time and money?"
    answer: "Automated testing reduces manual testing time by 60-80% and catches bugs earlier in the development cycle when they're cheaper to fix. Our automated test suites run continuously, providing instant feedback on code changes and preventing regression bugs from reaching production."
  - question: "What's your approach to QA for different project types?"
    answer: "We tailor our QA approach based on project needs: agile projects get continuous testing integration, legacy systems receive comprehensive regression testing, mobile apps get device-specific testing, and web applications receive cross-browser compatibility testing. Each project gets a customized QA strategy."
  - question: "How quickly can your QA team integrate with our development process?"
    answer: "Our pre-trained QA team can integrate within 1-2 weeks. We adapt to your existing development workflows, tools, and processes while implementing industry best practices. Most clients see immediate improvements in bug detection and release quality within the first sprint. We work closely with our [app and web development](/services/app-web-development/) team to ensure seamless Ruby on Rails testing integration from the start of development."
  - question: "Do you provide QA for both web and mobile applications?"
    answer: "Yes, we provide QA services for web applications, mobile apps (iOS and Android), APIs, and desktop applications. Our team has experience with responsive web testing, mobile device testing, API testing, and cross-platform compatibility validation."

overview:
  headline: Accelerate development & minimize risks
  list:
    - name: The Situation
      value: Software is rarely - if ever - developed perfectly on the first try and usually requires dedicated auditing, testing, and maintenance. The fastest way to build high-quality products with competitive user experiences is to implement a repeatable system for software quality assurance & testing.
    - name: The Problems
      value: Unfortunately, software QA & testing requires a dedicated team to accomplish it in-house, which can be very costly and impact the speed of development. The wrong software testing process can cost thousands of dollars and waste months of time. Even with a QA system in place, it takes technical leadership, operational structure, and dedicated supervision to successfully manage it internally.
    - name: Our Experiences
      value: JetThoughts provides on-demand access to a team of pre-trained product testing experts to help companies build faster and worry less about costly mistakes. As a fully-managed service, we can handle everything from setting up testing automation and QA processes to troubleshooting potential issues.
