overview:
  headline: Accelerate development & minimize risks
  list:
    - name: The Situation
      value: Software is rarely - if ever - developed perfectly on the first try and usually requires dedicated auditing, testing, and maintenance. The fastest way to build high-quality products with competitive user experiences is to implement a repeatable system for software quality assurance & testing.
    - name: The Problems
      value: Unfortunately, software QA & testing requires a dedicated team to accomplish it in-house, which can be very costly and impact the speed of development. The wrong software testing process can cost thousands of dollars and waste months of time. Even with a QA system in place, it takes technical leadership, operational structure, and dedicated supervision to successfully manage it internally.
    - name: Our Experiences
      value: JetThoughts provides on-demand access to a team of pre-trained product testing experts to help companies build faster and worry less about costly mistakes. As a fully-managed service, we can handle everything from setting up testing automation and QA processes to troubleshooting potential issues.
