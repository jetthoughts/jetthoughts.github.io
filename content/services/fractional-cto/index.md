faqs:
  - question: "What is a Fractional CTO?"
    answer: "A Fractional CTO is an experienced technology leader who provides part-time executive-level guidance to help companies make strategic technology decisions, build and lead development teams, and ensure successful product delivery. Unlike a full-time CTO, fractional CTOs work on a contract basis, offering the same expertise at a fraction of the cost."
  - question: "How much does fractional CTO cost compared to full-time?"
    answer: "Fractional CTO cost is typically 60-70% less than hiring a full-time CTO. While a full-time CTO salary ranges from $200,000-$400,000+ annually, our fractional CTO services provide the same strategic leadership and technical expertise at fractional CTO cost starting from $8,000-$15,000 monthly, making executive-level technology guidance accessible to startups and growing businesses."
  - question: "What responsibilities does a Fractional CTO handle?"
    answer: "Our Fractional CTOs handle technical vision and strategy, technology stack decisions, team hiring and management, code review and architecture oversight, project management and delivery, vendor evaluation and management, and risk assessment. They often work alongside our [fractional product management](/services/fractional-product-management/) team to align technical strategy with business goals, and can help scale your team through our [outsourced developer staffing](/services/outsourced-developer-staffing/) services."
  - question: "How does the engagement model work?"
    answer: "We offer flexible engagement models including part-time (10-20 hours/week), project-based contracts, interim CTO roles during transitions, and strategic consulting relationships. Most clients start with a part-time arrangement that can scale up or down based on your needs and growth stage."
  - question: "What experience do your Fractional CTOs have?"
    answer: "Our Fractional CTOs average 8+ years of development experience with 13+ years of industry experience. They've led technical teams, managed complex software projects, and helped companies scale from startup to enterprise level. All have hands-on experience with modern technology stacks and proven track records of successful product delivery."
