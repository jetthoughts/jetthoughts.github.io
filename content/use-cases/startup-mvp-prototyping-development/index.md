faqs:
  - question: "How long does it take to build a startup MVP with JetThoughts?"
    answer: "Most startup MVPs take 8-12 weeks with our rapid development process. Week 1-2: Technical discovery and architecture planning with fractional CTO oversight. Week 3-8: Agile development with senior Rails/React developers (8+ years experience). Week 9-10: QA, deployment, and launch preparation. This delivers functional MVPs 3x faster than traditional 24-week agency timelines."

  - question: "What's the cost of MVP development compared to hiring a full development team?"
    answer: "Our MVP development costs 50% less than hiring full-time developers. Typical MVP investment: $40K-80K over 8-12 weeks vs $120K-200K+ for 6-month full-time team hiring and development. You get immediate access to senior developers without recruiting costs, equity dilution, or long-term employment commitments."

  - question: "How do you ensure MVP quality while delivering quickly?"
    answer: "We maintain quality through experienced team oversight (8+ years average developer experience), proven Rails/React architecture patterns, continuous code review, automated testing, and fractional CTO strategic guidance. Our 95% client retention rate reflects consistent quality delivery across 200+ successful projects."

## The Startup MVP Challenge

**The Problem Startups Face**:

Building a successful startup requires validating product ideas quickly while managing limited resources. Most startups struggle with:

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Pressure**: Need to validate product-market fit before runway expires (typically 12-18 months)
- üí∞ **Budget Constraints**: Limited funding ($100K-500K seed) must cover development, marketing, and operations
- üë• **Talent Competition**: Difficulty hiring experienced developers in competitive markets (6-12 months recruiting timeline)
- üéØ **Product Risk**: Risk of over-engineering before market validation (70% of features go unused)
- üìä **Investor Expectations**: Pressure to demonstrate traction and technical capability for Series A fundraising

**Traditional Approach Fails**:
Most startups attempt to hire full-time developers or engage traditional agencies, resulting in 24-week development timelines, $200K+ costs, and missed market opportunities. The lengthy hiring process (6+ months) delays product development, while agencies lack startup expertise to balance speed with scalability.
