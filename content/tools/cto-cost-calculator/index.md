faqs:
  - question: "How do I choose between fractional CTO and full-time CTO?"
    answer: "Choose fractional CTO if you need strategic guidance 10-30 hours/week, want to save 60-70% on costs, or don't have full-time CTO-level work. Choose full-time CTO when you have 40+ hours of strategic work weekly and can afford $280K-650K annually."
  - question: "What's the difference between emergency CTO and fractional CTO?"
    answer: "Emergency CTO provides crisis response for technical disasters with 24/7 availability for 30-90 days ($15K-25K/month). Fractional CTO offers ongoing strategic partnership for 6-24 months ($8K-18K/month) focused on growth and planning."
  - question: "How accurate are the CTO cost calculator results?"
    answer: "Our calculator is based on 500+ CTO engagements and current market data. Results are 90% accurate within estimated ranges, with final pricing depending on specific requirements, urgency, and engagement duration."
  - question: "Can I transition between different CTO service types?"
    answer: "Yes! Many clients start with emergency CTO for crisis resolution, then transition to fractional CTO for ongoing strategic guidance. We maintain context and continuity throughout service transitions."
  - question: "What factors affect CTO service costs the most?"
    answer: "Key factors include: company stage, team size, expertise requirements (security/compliance), time commitment, urgency level, and engagement duration. Enterprise companies with large teams require higher investment."
