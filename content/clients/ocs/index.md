**Client Overview**
-------------------

OrchestrateCS is a startup building software to help unify, simplify, and standardize both people and compliance operations.

They initially reached out to JetThoughts to help them go from zero to revenue by making their first product idea a reality.

**Vision**
----------

OrchestrateCS envisioned a new software idea from scratch to pursue a new business opportunity that had emerged in their industry.

Given the time-sensitive nature of this project, OrchestrateCS desired to develop a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and go-to-market as quickly as possible.

**Problem**
-----------

OrchestrateCS was driven by a group of business executives and growth experts. However, they lacked the technical knowledge & talent to make their software idea a reality.

Because of the hasty timeline for delivering the MVP, OrchestrateCS knew it would be unrealistic to build any worthwhile development team internally.

In addition, they realized that their unique situation would required a specific type of software development vendor that had the experience needed to deliver positive outcomes on-time.

**Solution**
------------

JetThoughts provided a fractional CTO resource to help guide the project and 2 full-time engineers to act as a virtual development team for OrchestrateCS.

In addition, we provided a dedicated project advisor to bring real-time visibility into progress and ensure alignment with the leadership team at OrchestrateCS.

**Approach**
------------

From the very beginning of the engagement, JetThoughts provided OrchestrateCS' team with deep technical guidance based on decades of experience to help ensure a successful outcome.

We started the project with a kick-off meeting where we set expectations for the engagement, learned about the software idea, and aligned around a winning strategy.

To provide clarity into process & outcomes, we aligned around a simple development framework that enabled OrchestrateCS to monitor budget & maximize the value delivered by our team.

Throughout the entirety of the engagement, we kept the team composition flexible to the specific needs and circumstances that OrchestrateCS faced.

**Outcome**
-----------

- Conceptualized a successful MVP build from scratch.
- From zero to live MVP in less than 60 days.
- Owned roadmap, UX/UI, & product management.
