Agent Inbox is an industry-leading real estate messaging platform that leverages Multiple Listing Services (MLS) data to help centralize & streamline deal-making for realtors.

Agent Inbox envisioned an idea to create a competitive software product to disrupt real estate communication.

To attract investors and customers as quickly as possible, Agent Inbox desired to develop a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) that could be used as a foundation for additional development.

They initially reached out to JetThoughts to make their product idea a reality and help build the right internal development team for long-term success.

The challenge
-------------

Agent Inbox initially tried to develop their product internally, but ran into obstacles with the project's complexity.

After a full year attempting to develop the product internally, Agent Inbox struggled to deliver a market-ready solution and realized the platform would need to be rebuilt from scratch.

With limited resources & technical expertise available, it became apparent that their current internal development team wouldn't be able to realistically deliver the right outcome on time.

The solution
------------

JetThoughts provided a fractional CTO resource to help guide the project and 5 full-time engineers to act as a virtual development team for Agent Inbox.

In addition, we provided a dedicated project advisor to bring real-time visibility into progress and ensure alignment with the leadership team at Agent Inbox.

From the very beginning of the engagement, JetThoughts provided Agent Inbox's team with deep technical guidance based on decades of experience to help ensure a successful outcome.

We started the project with a kick-off meeting where we set expectations for the engagement, learned about the software idea, and aligned around a winning strategy.

To provide clarity into process & outcomes, we aligned around a simple development framework that enabled Agent Inbox to monitor budget & maximize the value delivered by our team.

Throughout the entirety of the engagement, we kept the team composition flexible to the specific needs and circumstances that Agent Inbox faced.
