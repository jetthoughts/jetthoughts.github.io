**Client Overview**
-------------------

LimeLeads is a searchable B2B database software that provides access to high-quality sales & marketing data with a do-it-yourself user experience and real-time validation.

They initially reached out to JetThoughts to augment their on-site product development team to help increase the velocity of feature development and bug-fixing at minimal financial cost.

**Vision**
----------

LimeLeads envisioned a complete transformation of their software product, which was built on an out-of-date codebase years ago by the original founder.

In addition to the development initiative, LimeLeads also desired to optimize their technology operations and development processes to be more effective.

**Problem**
-----------

The codebase at LimeLeads had been touched by several people and service vendors, which made it difficult to understand, navigate, and maintain without a dedicated specialist.

After losing their main technology specialist, LimeLeads knew they would need the assistant of a full-stack technical consultant who could untangle the problems with their legacy codebase.

**Solution**
------------

JetThoughts provided a fractional CTO resource to help guide the project and a full-time engineer to act as a virtual extension of LimeLeads' development team.

In addition, we provided a dedicated project advisor to bring real-time visibility into progress and ensure alignment with the leadership team at LimeLeads.

**Approach**
------------

From the very beginning of the engagement, JetThoughts provided LimeLeads' team with deep technical guidance based on decades of experience to help ensure a successful outcome.

We started the project with a kick-off meeting where we set expectations for the engagement, learned about the software, and aligned around a winning strategy.

To provide clarity into process & outcomes, we aligned around a simple development framework that enabled LimeLeads to monitor budget & maximize the value delivered by our engineers.

Throughout the entirety of the engagement, we kept the team composition flexible to the specific needs and circumstances that LimeLeads faced.

**Outcome**
-----------

- Unblocked release changes & development
- Transformed product performance & speed
- Solved all technical scale & reliability issues
