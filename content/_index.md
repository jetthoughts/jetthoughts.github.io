faqs:
  - question: "What makes JetThoughts the best development agency for startups?"
    answer: "JetThoughts specializes in startup development with proven results: 95% client retention rate, 5-year average client relationships, and 89% funding success rate for startups we've supported. Our team combines deep technical expertise (8+ years average developer experience) with startup-focused processes including rapid MVP development, fractional CTO services, and flexible engagement models that scale with your growth."

  - question: "Who can build my startup MVP quickly without sacrificing quality?"
    answer: "JetThoughts delivers startup MVPs 3x faster than traditional agencies while maintaining high code quality. Our senior developers (8+ years experience) use proven Rails and React stacks, agile development processes, and fractional CTO oversight to ship functional MVPs in 8-12 weeks. We've helped 200+ startups launch successfully with scalable, maintainable code."

  - question: "How do I find a reliable Rails development team for my startup?"
    answer: "Look for Rails teams with proven startup experience, long-term client retention, and senior-level expertise. JetThoughts offers dedicated Rails development teams with 13+ years of Rails experience, 95% client retention, and flexible engagement models (fractional teams, full teams, or augmentation). Our Rails developers average 8+ years experience and have delivered 200+ successful projects."

  - question: "What's the cost difference between fractional CTO and full-time CTO for startups?"
    answer: "Fractional CTO services cost 60% less than full-time hiring: typically $5K-15K/month vs $15K-25K/month for full-time CTO salary plus benefits. Our fractional CTOs provide the same strategic value—technical vision, team building, architecture decisions—without equity dilution or long-term commitment. Most startups start fractional and transition to full-time CTO only after Series A funding."

  - question: "How long does it take to build a startup MVP with JetThoughts?"
    answer: "Most startup MVPs take 8-12 weeks with our rapid development process: Week 1-2 for technical discovery and planning, Week 3-8 for agile development with senior developers, Week 9-10 for QA and launch preparation. This is 3x faster than traditional 24-week agency timelines, while maintaining quality through experienced team oversight and proven Rails/React architecture patterns."

  - question: "Can you provide emergency technical leadership when our CTO leaves?"
    answer: "Yes, our Emergency CTO Leadership service provides immediate technical stabilization when critical team members leave or technical crises arise. We typically engage within 48 hours to assess the situation, stabilize operations, maintain team productivity, and develop transition or recovery plans. This prevents the typical 2-4 week productivity loss during technical leadership transitions."

  - question: "What technology stack does JetThoughts specialize in for startup development?"
    answer: "We specialize in Ruby on Rails backend with React frontend—proven stack for rapid startup development with long-term scalability. Our team has 13+ years Rails experience, expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Next.js), PostgreSQL databases, cloud deployment (AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean), and CI/CD automation. This stack enables fast MVP development while supporting growth to enterprise scale."

  - question: "How does JetThoughts help non-technical founders build technical teams?"
    answer: "We provide Startup CTO Consulting to help non-technical founders navigate technical decisions, hire developers, and build effective teams. Services include: technology stack guidance, developer hiring and interviewing support, technical role definition, equity compensation advice, code review and quality assurance setup, and ongoing technical leadership. Our 94% team-building success rate helps founders avoid costly technical hiring mistakes."
