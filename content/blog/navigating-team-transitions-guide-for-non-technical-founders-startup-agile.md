The dilemma is how to replace a compact yet efficient team. Your workforce consists of engineers and support staff. They have handled operations with skill up to this point. But expenses are increasing, and the outdated codebase is proving problematic. How can you navigate this shift without disrupting the established workflow?

First, familiarize yourself with [ADKAR](https://jetthoughts.com/blog/transforming-titans-outsourcing-odyssey-leadership-agile/) (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement).

ADKAR steers organizations through intricate changes. It is your guide to a smoother transformation. It shows the need for change and a desire to help. It means knowing how to change, being able to do it, and supporting its maintenance.

It is a powerful tool. This framework is not a buzzword. It will build your confidence in managing this transition.


Awareness: Be transparent.
-------------------------

Transparency is crucial in every situation. Always involve your team in decisions. Discuss finances, technical issues, and goals openly. This helps them understand changes. It builds trust and support.

I once consulted for a startup facing high costs. The CEO had to replace the entire development team. So, he called a town hall meeting. There, he shared financial data and risks. Despite its difficulty, his openness fostered readiness for change.

Desire: Foster buy-in.
---------------------

After explaining the necessity for change, it is important to cultivate a sense of desire to support it. Emphasize the advantages for your team, such as new technology, fresh challenges, and improved job stability in the long run.

Consider providing incentives, such as bonuses, to those who stay and assist with the transition.

Knowledge: Equip the team.
-------------------------

New employees should learn the old code and current processes. So, we need clear documentation. Pair them with experienced members for easy knowledge sharing. Also, provide hands-on training.

Ability: Provide resources.
--------------------------

Give your new team the tools and support they need to succeed. This might include training funds or temporary consultants.

I was lucky to work with a company that provided a full "transition toolkit." It had detailed documentation, video tutorials for training, and support from the departing team. The team absorbed concepts using this method.


Reinforcement: Keep it going.
----------------------------

Reinforcement is critical to ensuring lasting change. This includes regular check-ins, feedback loops, and ongoing support. Acknowledge even small successes. It will boost morale. High morale is key to keeping your team motivated during the transition.


Avoiding Pitfalls. What Not to Do: Don't Go Dark
------------------------------------------------

It is important to be mindful of certain missteps to avoid potential issues. One such mistake is going dark.

Put yourself in the shoes of someone who discovers their boss is hiring a replacement behind their back. The sense of betrayal would be devastating. As a manager, avoid sneaking around and keeping secrets; this will only lead to bitterness and decreased employee morale.

"Be open and honest about your intentions and allow your current team the opportunity to be involved in the shift. Their perspectives and support can greatly benefit the training of their successors."

Motivating the Current Team:
----------------------------

**Keep communication open:** Regular updates ease concerns.

**Show appreciation:** Thank your team. Small gestures matter.

**Involve your team:** Their experience is key. It boosts the transition.

For example, a startup CEO offered part-time work to the departing team. Meanwhile, the new team was in training. He promised a bonus for staying until the transition ended. This kept everyone motivated.

In summary, change is tough but manageable with a clear plan and good communication. Use the ADKAR model. Involve your team. Their support is crucial.

**Remember:** be transparent, gain support, prepare your team, offer resources, and reinforce change. You're not changing teams. You're paving the way for your startup's future.

Stay strong and lead with clarity!
