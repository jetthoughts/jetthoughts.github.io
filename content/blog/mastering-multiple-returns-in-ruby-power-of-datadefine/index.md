In the world of Ruby programming, returning multiple values from a method can often lead to confusion and bugs. A recent discussion highlighted the challenges developers face when using traditional methods to return multiple outputs. This article explores a modern solution using `Data.define`, which simplifies the process and enhances code readability.

### Key Takeaways

*   Returning multiple values can create confusion due to positional dependencies.
*   Using hashes can alleviate some issues but may introduce others.
*   `Data.define` offers an immutable and clear way to return multiple values.

### The Challenge of Returning Multiple Values

Returning multiple values from a method in Ruby is a common practice, but it comes with its own set of challenges. For instance, consider the following method:

    def something_with_two_outputs
      a = parse_data
      b = process_result
    
      return a, b
    end
    

When calling this method, the order of the returned values can lead to confusion:

    parsed_data, result = something_with_two_outputs
    

If a developer mistakenly swaps the variables, it can lead to bugs that are hard to trace.

### The Problems with Traditional Methods

1.  **Positional Dependency**: The order of returned values can be misinterpreted, leading to potential errors.
2.  **Lack of Clarity**: Without looking at the method's implementation, it's difficult to understand what each return value represents.

### A Better Approach: Using Hashes

One common workaround is to return a hash:

    def parse(response)
      {
        header: headers(response),
        parsed_body: parse_body(response)
      }
    end
    

While this method improves clarity, it has its drawbacks:

*   **Immutability**: Hashes are mutable, which can lead to unintended side effects.
*   **Searchability**: Finding specific keys can be cumbersome, especially in larger codebases.

### Enter Data.define

With the introduction of Ruby 3.2, the `Data` class provides a robust solution for returning multiple values. By using `Data.define`, developers can create immutable objects that clearly define the structure of returned data:

    Response = Data.define(:headers, :parsed_body)
    
    def parse(client_response)
      headers = parse_headers(client_response)
      parsed_body = parse_body(client_response)
    
      Response.new(headers: headers, parsed_body: parsed_body)
    end
    

This approach offers several advantages:

1.  **Immutability**: Attempting to modify the response will raise an error, preventing accidental changes.
2.  **Clarity**: The names of the getters provide immediate understanding of the data structure.
3.  **Ease of Use**: Developers can access the data without delving into the method's internals.

### Extending Functionality with Data.define

The `Data` class also allows for the creation of more complex data structures. For example, if you want to include rate limit information in your response, you can define another `Data` object:

    RateLimit = Data.define(:remaining, :reset_in)
    Response = Data.define(:headers, :parsed_body, :rate_limit)
    
    def parse(client_response)
      headers = parse_headers(client_response)
      parsed_body = parse_body(client_response)
      rate_limit = RateLimit.new(
        remaining: headers[:rate-limit-remaining],
        reset_in: headers[:rate-limit-reset].to_i
      )
    
      Response.new(
        headers: headers,
        parsed_body: parsed_body,
        rate_limit: rate_limit
      )
    end
    

### Conclusion

The ability to return multiple values from a method in Ruby is essential, but it should not come at the cost of code clarity and maintainability. By leveraging `Data.define`, developers can create clear, immutable data structures that enhance the readability and reliability of their code. This modern approach not only simplifies the process but also encourages better coding practices in the Ruby community.
