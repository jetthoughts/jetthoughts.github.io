## What is SCIPAB?

SCIPAB helps you make your point fast. Think of it as a recipe for clear business communication. Each letter stands for a step in your message. Business moves fast. Your communication must keep up. SCIPAB cuts through noise and gets to the point.

Many leaders struggle with clear communication. Messages get lost. Meetings run long. Decisions stall. SCIPAB fixes these problems.

## Why SCIPAB Works

Your brain loves stories. SCIPAB turns business messages into mini-stories. Each part builds on the last. This makes your message stick. Your audience follows along. They remember what matters.

Good stories move people to act. SCIPAB builds these stories step by step. No guessing. No confusion. Just clear paths to decisions.

## The Six Steps in Detail

### S = Situation

Start with what's happening now. Paint the picture. Use facts. Keep it short.

Strong Examples:

- "Our app has 10,000 users."
- "Sales hit $1M last quarter."
- "Customer support handles 100 tickets daily."

Weak Examples:

- "Things are going well." (too vague)
- "We have lots of users." (no numbers)
- "The situation is complex." (says nothing)

Tips for Situation:

1. Use real numbers
2. State facts, not opinions
3. Focus on what matters now
4. Keep to one or two sentences
5. Start with your strongest fact
