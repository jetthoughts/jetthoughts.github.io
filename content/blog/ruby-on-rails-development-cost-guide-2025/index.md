## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Rails still relevant in 2025?

Absolutely. Rails remains one of the most productive web development frameworks, with active development and a thriving ecosystem. Major companies like GitHub, Shopify, and Airbnb continue to use Rails for critical systems.

### How does Rails development cost compare to other frameworks?

Rails typically offers faster development compared to Java or .NET, reducing overall costs. Compared to Node.js or Python, Rails provides more conventions and built-in features, often resulting in 20-30% faster development for web applications.

### What's the minimum budget for a Rails application?

For a basic web application with essential features, budget at least $15,000-$25,000. This covers MVP development with core functionality, basic design, and initial deployment.
