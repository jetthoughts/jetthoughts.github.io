*After reading thousands of posts, it’s time to share a workflow that will help those who are creating amazing things to blog more easily and often.*

Here, in JetThoughts we highlight 3 main principles that helped us overcome a barrier of writing fast, and can definitely help you with it.

Let’s start!

##**Practical**##
When people query keywords within Google, what they typically need is an answer/solution, and the search engines do deliver well at this. So also it is when folks are reading your content — they simply want an answer.

So, what is the problem? How did you discover the problem? Clarify it and investigate the various factors about each of the potential solutions.

You note down the good and bad points and other things that are relevant to each solution. Look through the various influencing factors for each possible solution and decide which solutions to keep and which to disregard. Share your experience with readers.

##**Clear**##
Readers who can’t understand your content well probably won’t keep reading for long. If the articles in your blog are boring or confusing, they won’t attract people to you, your website, etc. Readers will move on to clearer content, which may belong to your competitors when your writing is too hard to comprehend.

Create understandable content by using short paragraphs and subheadings, presenting ideas in a logical order, using examples, avoiding difficult words, writing for a target audience, and testing readability.

##**Time-effective**##
How to make it more effective? Frontloading! What is it?
The approach of offering the most important information before filling in on the secondary details is called frontloading. An effective frontloading distills the most important information for the reader.

Authors front-load because it solves a lot of problems. Chiefly, this is because dumping information on the reader immediately brings them up to speed with everything they need to know, and the story can continue unfettered from that point on.

The reader doesn’t necessarily want to know all the background information that led to the decision. He or she likely wants to know “how does this information affect me?” and this principle should answer this question every time.
