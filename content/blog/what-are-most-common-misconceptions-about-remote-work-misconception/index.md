*A lot of people don’t know the truth about what it’s like to work from home. It seems to me that the first thing that comes to mind when you think of remote work is freelancing. Absolutely no, companies are aware of the many advantages connected with moving away from offices, so that’s why it’s so popular nowadays. It has also been shown that more and more remote job openings for full-time and part-time as well as are being opened.*

*Here are just six myths that are common the most.*

## Remote workers don’t work at all

Usually, topping the list is the misconception that remote workers aren’t really working at all. It’s often said that remote workers just watch TV, play computer games, or completing household chores instead of getting work done.

The reality is that most work-from-home professionals are more productive than in-office workers. But how is it possible? Nobody or nothing wants you to be interrupted or distracted from work. Usually, companies set up the exact number of working hours.

## Remote workers don’t belong to company culture

It’s a common misconception, and it’s understandable why. Guess you heard about freelancers and their attitude to work. I mean, they do work at the most suitable time and price for them and clients. But what about remote companies? Is it the same? Absolutely — no. We work in the same way as an office.

## Remote employees should be available 24/7

It’s believed that remote workers are expected to be available 24/7 as almost a form of payment for working remotely. But actually, it’s no true. Everybody has working schedules, so you can work in a way that suits you. Depending on your natural body clock, you may work well at 1 am, 4 pm or 8 am. Remote workers keep similar schedules to their office counterparts, and the same expectations of work-life balance should be placed upon them. Usually, it’s an eight-hour day. The best option here is clear communication, so when you work remotely, you need to warn colleagues about your working time, in order not to disturb others.

## Remote work is distracting

Offices can be loud and very disruptive places. One person speaking on the phone may be doing their job, but also distracting another worker who is trying to solve a problem or colleagues who want you to drink coffee with. Remote workers can often avoid these things and stay on task longer. It’s easy to concentrate on work in silence.

Even more, 86% of employees say they’re most productive when they work alone — devoid of distractions like inefficient meetings, office gossip, or loud office spaces. And it’s true!

## Remote work makes you feel loneliness

Working remotely does not mean being at home all day and all night. Sure, someone prefers to work alone in their home, but that’s not only the one option. Nowadays, there are various coworking spaces, coffee shops, and cafes for these “office-less” workers. If you might feel lonely, take your laptop and visit some of these places!

Besides, you can meet somebody new and make friends.

Furthermore, in [JetThoughts](https://www.jetthoughts.com/), we chat every day, using Discord. Team members who are from the same city, can meet and work together. We also try to minimize situations in which people are left alone, and we strive to support each other in the distance. So, we frequently do video conferencing.
