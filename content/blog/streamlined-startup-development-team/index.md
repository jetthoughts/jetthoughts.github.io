Starting a new venture is hard, especially for non-tech founders. Finding the right remote developers can be a big challenge. Here's a simple guide to build an effective team that can launch your MVP and find market fit fast.

## The Hiring Challenge

Non-tech founders often struggle to hire good remote developers. This can lead to delays and high costs. To avoid these issues, focus on key roles with specific skills.

## Key Roles for Your Team

### Part-time Product Manager

A part-time product manager is crucial for your startup's success. They help by:

- **Doing Customer Research**: They learn what customers need.
- **Reviewing Opportunities**: They look at market trends and competitors.
- **Prioritizing Features**: They decide which features are most important.


### Full-stack Developers

You need two full-stack developers who know Ruby on Rails or Laravel. Look for these traits:

- **Self-managed**: They handle their tasks without much oversight.
- **Test-driven Development (TDD)**: Ensures high-quality code.
- **Async Updates**: Regular updates via Slack or email keep everyone in sync.
- **Small Chunks Delivery**: Deliver work in small parts for quick feedback.


## Daily Releases Matter

Daily releases are key to keeping momentum:

1. **Get Feedback Fast**: Quick user feedback helps fix issues early.
1. **High Quality**: Smaller changes make it easier to spot errors.
1. **Boost Morale**: Seeing daily progress keeps the team motivated.


## Structuring Your Team

With one part-time product manager and two self-managed full-stack developers, you have all you need to build a good MVP quickly.

### Best Practices for Remote Teams

To get the best from your remote team:

1. Use clear communication tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams.
1. Have daily stand-up meetings to stay aligned.
1. Do peer code reviews to ensure quality.
1. Keep detailed documentation of all project aspects.


## Conclusion

Building a startup team doesn't have to be tough, even if you're not tech-savvy. With a focused approach—hiring a part-time product manager and skilled full-stack developers—you set yourself up for success with daily releases and best practices in place.

This way, you can launch an MVP that meets market needs while positioning your company for growth in the future.
