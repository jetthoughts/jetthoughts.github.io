`ActiveRecord::Enum` in Rails have long been a convenient tool for representing a set of symbolic values within a model. However, using `enum` can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially when it comes to the automatic generation of instance methods. 
For instance, consider an `Order` model with an `enum` for status:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  enum status: [:pending, :processed]
end
```

Instance objects would have a convenient methods like `order.pending?`, `order.processed?`. 
One of common possible issues with generated instance methods might be naming conflicts. For example, if we need to add a new status `persisted` for our `Order` model.
```ruby 
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  enum status: [:pending, :processed, :persisted]
end
```
Simple adding it to the `enum` definition would lead to an `ArgumentError`:
```
You tried to define an enum named "status" on the model
"Order", but this will generate a instance method
"persisted?", which is already defined by Active Record.
(ArgumentError)
```
We can fix it by adding `_prefix`/`_suffix` option for the `enum`:
```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  enum status: [:pending, :processed, :persisted], _prefix: true
end
```
But then we'll have to update `#pending?`/`#processed?` usages to `#status_pending?`/`#status_processed?`.

## With Rails 7.1

In Rails 7.1, a new option `_instance_methods` is [introduced](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46490), allowing developers to opt-out of the automatic generation of instance methods for `enum`s. When `enum` is defined with  `_instance_methods: false`, Rails will no longer generate methods like `pending?`, `processed?`, etc.

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  enum status: [:pending, :processed, :persisted], _instance_methods: false
end
```
Now we can define custom methods tailored to the specific needs without worrying about conflicts with automatically generated `enum` methods.

## Benefits
- **Reduced Method Clutter**: By disabling the automatic generation of `enum` methods, we can keep model interfaces cleaner and more focused.

- **Flexibility in Method Naming**: With `enum` instance methods disabled, we have the freedom to name methods the way we want to make the codebase more expressive and easier to understand.

- **Avoidance of Method Name Conflicts**: In scenarios where `enum` method names clash with existing or future method names in the model, disabling `enum` instance methods can prevent potential conflicts and bugs.

- **Improved Performance**: By reducing the number of automatically generated methods, there may be a slight improvement in application performance, especially in cases where models have numerous `enum` attributes.
