In a challenging time for David Lieb and his team, they faced the pressure of high expectations. With 150 million users of their app Bump, they were at the top, but they knew it was all about to change. Their second app, Flock, didn’t take off either. Running low on funds, they needed a new direction. This is the story of how they turned their struggles into the foundation for Google Photos.

### Key Takeaways

*   Bump was a hit but faced inevitable failure.
*   Flock didn’t succeed, leading to financial pressure.
*   Paul Graham’s advice pushed them to think bigger.
*   They decided to **build a better photo app**.

### The Pressure of Success

When you have a popular app like Bump, the pressure can be intense. David and his team had 150 million users, but they felt the weight of knowing it wouldn’t last. They were in a tough spot. Their second app, Flock, didn’t work out either. With money running low, they had to act fast.

### A Meeting with Paul Graham

In their search for solutions, they turned to Paul Graham. He’s a big name in the startup world and had some solid advice. They explained their situation, and he challenged them to think bigger. Instead of just improving Flock, he suggested they replace the entire photos app on the iPhone. At first, this seemed crazy. How could they take on such a big task?

### Rethinking the Photos App

After some thought, they realized the existing photos app wasn’t that great. They could do better. They had a vision for a photo-sharing app that people would actually want to use. So, they decided to go for it. With only four or five months of runway left, they jumped in.

### Building the New Product

The team got to work. They focused on creating a user-friendly experience. They wanted to make sharing photos easy and fun. Here’s what they aimed to improve:

*   **User Interface**: Make it simple and clean.
*   **Sharing Options**: Allow users to share with friends easily.
*   **Storage**: Provide ample space for photos.

### The Result: Google Photos

What started as a struggle turned into a game-changer. Their hard work paid off, and they eventually built what we now know as Google Photos. It became a go-to app for photo storage and sharing. The team took their challenges and turned them into a successful product that millions use today.

### Conclusion

David Lieb and his team faced tough times, but they didn’t give up. They took advice, rethought their approach, and built something amazing. Their journey shows that sometimes, failure can lead to great success. So, the next time you hit a wall, remember: it might just be the start of something new!
