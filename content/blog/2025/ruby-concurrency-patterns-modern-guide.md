Ruby has evolved dramatically in its concurrency capabilities. From the early days of the Global Interpreter Lock (GVL) limiting true parallelism to Ruby 3.4's sophisticated concurrency primitives, the landscape has transformed. This comprehensive guide explores modern Ruby concurrency patterns, helping you choose the right approach for your applications.

## Understanding Ruby's Concurrency Evolution

Ruby's concurrency story began with threads hampered by the GVL, evolved through fibers for cooperative concurrency, and now includes Ractors for true parallelism. Each approach serves specific use cases, and understanding when to use each is crucial for building performant applications.

### The Concurrency Spectrum

```ruby
# Sequential Processing (Baseline)
def process_users_sequential(users)
  users.map { |user| expensive_operation(user) }
end

# Concurrent Processing with Threads
def process_users_concurrent(users)
  users.map { |user| Thread.new { expensive_operation(user) } }
       .map(&:value)
end

# Parallel Processing with Ractors
def process_users_parallel(users)
  ractors = users.map { |user|
    Ractor.new(user) { |u| expensive_operation(u) }
  }
  ractors.map(&:take)
end
```

## Thread-Based Concurrency Patterns

Threads remain the foundation of Ruby concurrency, especially for I/O-bound operations where the GVL releases allow genuine concurrent execution.

### Thread Pool Pattern

Managing thread creation overhead through pooling:

```ruby
class ThreadPool
  def initialize(size = 4)
    @size = size
    @jobs = Queue.new
    @pool = Array.new(size) do
      Thread.new do
        loop do
          job = @jobs.pop
          break if job == :shutdown
          job.call
        end
      end
    end
  end

  def schedule(&block)
    @jobs << block
  end

  def shutdown
    @size.times { @jobs << :shutdown }
    @pool.map(&:join)
  end
end

# Usage Example
pool = ThreadPool.new(8)

users.each do |user|
  pool.schedule do
    process_user(user)
  end
end

pool.shutdown
```

### Producer-Consumer Pattern

Using threads for background processing:

```ruby
class BackgroundProcessor
  def initialize
    @queue = Queue.new
    @shutdown = false
    start_workers
  end

  def enqueue(item)
    @queue << item unless @shutdown
  end

  def shutdown
    @shutdown = true
    @workers.each { @queue << :shutdown }
    @workers.map(&:join)
  end

  private

  def start_workers
    @workers = 4.times.map do
      Thread.new do
        loop do
          item = @queue.pop
          break if item == :shutdown

          process_item(item)
        rescue => e
          handle_error(e, item)
        end
      end
    end
  end

  def process_item(item)
    # Your processing logic here
    puts "Processing #{item}"
    sleep(0.1) # Simulate work
  end

  def handle_error(error, item)
    puts "Error processing #{item}: #{error.message}"
  end
end
```

### Thread-Safe Data Structures

Ensuring thread safety with Ruby's concurrent data structures:

```ruby
require 'concurrent-ruby'

class MetricsCollector
  def initialize
    @counters = Concurrent::Hash.new(0)
    @timings = Concurrent::Array.new
    @mutex = Mutex.new
  end

  def increment_counter(key)
    @counters.compute(key) { |current| current + 1 }
  end

  def record_timing(operation, duration)
    @timings << { operation: operation, duration: duration, timestamp: Time.now }
  end

  def statistics
    @mutex.synchronize do
      {
        counters: @counters.to_h,
        average_timing: calculate_average,
        total_operations: @timings.size
      }
    end
  end

  private

  def calculate_average
    return 0 if @timings.empty?
    @timings.sum { |t| t[:duration] } / @timings.size.to_f
  end
end
```

## Fiber-Based Async Programming

Fibers enable cooperative concurrency, perfect for I/O-intensive operations without the overhead of thread switching.

### Fiber Scheduler Implementation

Ruby 3.0+ supports fiber schedulers for async I/O:

```ruby
require 'async'
require 'async/http/internet'

class AsyncDataProcessor
  def initialize
    @internet = Async::HTTP::Internet.new
  end

  def process_urls(urls)
    Async do
      tasks = urls.map do |url|
        Async do
          response = @internet.get(url)
          process_response(response)
        end
      end

      results = tasks.map(&:wait)
      results.compact
    end
  end

  private

  def process_response(response)
    return nil unless response.success?

    {
      url: response.request.uri.to_s,
      status: response.status,
      content_length: response.body.length,
      timestamp: Time.now
    }
  end
end

# Usage
processor = AsyncDataProcessor.new
urls = %w[
  https://api.github.com/users/thoughtbot
  https://api.github.com/users/rails
  https://api.github.com/users/ruby
]

results = processor.process_urls(urls).wait
puts "Processed #{results.size} URLs concurrently"
```

### Custom Fiber Patterns

Building cooperative multitasking systems:

```ruby
class FiberScheduler
  def initialize
    @fibers = []
    @current = 0
  end

  def add_fiber(&block)
    @fibers << Fiber.new(&block)
  end

  def run
    until @fibers.empty?
      fiber = @fibers[@current]

      result = fiber.resume

      if fiber.alive?
        @current = (@current + 1) % @fibers.size
      else
        @fibers.delete_at(@current)
        @current = 0 if @current >= @fibers.size
      end
    end
  end
end

# Usage Example
scheduler = FiberScheduler.new

scheduler.add_fiber do
  5.times do |i|
    puts "Fiber 1: #{i}"
    Fiber.yield
  end
end

scheduler.add_fiber do
  3.times do |i|
    puts "Fiber 2: #{i * 10}"
    Fiber.yield
  end
end

scheduler.run
```

## Ractor-Based True Parallelism

Ractors provide true parallelism by removing shared mutable state, enabling CPU-intensive parallel processing.

### Basic Ractor Patterns

```ruby
# Simple parallel map with Ractors
def parallel_map(collection, &block)
  ractors = collection.map do |item|
    Ractor.new(item, &block)
  end

  ractors.map(&:take)
end

# CPU-intensive example
def fibonacci(n)
  return n if n <= 1
  fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
end

numbers = [35, 36, 37, 38]
results = parallel_map(numbers) { |n| fibonacci(n) }
puts "Results: #{results}"
```

### Ractor Pipeline Pattern

Creating processing pipelines with Ractors:

```ruby
class RactorPipeline
  def initialize
    @stages = []
  end

  def add_stage(&block)
    @stages << block
  end

  def process(input_data)
    channels = create_channels
    workers = create_workers(channels)

    # Send input data
    input_data.each { |data| channels.first.send(data) }
    channels.first.close

    # Collect results
    results = []
    while result = channels.last.receive
      results << result
    end

    workers.each(&:take) # Wait for completion
    results
  end

  private

  def create_channels
    @stages.map { Ractor.new { loop { Ractor.receive } } }
  end

  def create_workers(channels)
    @stages.each_with_index.map do |stage, index|
      input_channel = channels[index]
      output_channel = channels[index + 1]

      Ractor.new(stage, input_channel, output_channel) do |processor, input, output|
        while data = input.take
          result = processor.call(data)
          output.send(result) if result
        end
        output.close
      end
    end
  end
end

# Usage
pipeline = RactorPipeline.new
pipeline.add_stage { |x| x * 2 }      # Double
pipeline.add_stage { |x| x + 10 }     # Add 10
pipeline.add_stage { |x| x if x > 50 } # Filter

results = pipeline.process([1, 25, 50, 75])
puts "Pipeline results: #{results}" # [60, 160]
```

### Ractor-Safe Data Sharing

Sharing immutable data between Ractors:

```ruby
class ImmutableConfig
  def initialize(data)
    @data = data.freeze
  end

  def get(key)
    @data[key]
  end

  def to_h
    @data.dup
  end
end

# Shareable configuration
config = ImmutableConfig.new({
  api_url: "https://api.example.com",
  timeout: 30,
  retries: 3
}).freeze

# Use in Ractors
workers = 4.times.map do |i|
  Ractor.new(config, i) do |cfg, worker_id|
    # Each Ractor gets its own copy of the frozen config
    puts "Worker #{worker_id}: API URL = #{cfg.get(:api_url)}"

    # Simulate work with config
    cfg.get(:retries).times do |attempt|
      puts "Worker #{worker_id}, attempt #{attempt + 1}"
      sleep(0.1)
    end
  end
end

workers.each(&:take)
```

## Performance Analysis and Benchmarking

Understanding the performance characteristics of different concurrency approaches is crucial for making informed decisions.

### Benchmarking Concurrency Patterns

```ruby
require 'benchmark'

def cpu_intensive_task(n)
  (1..n).reduce(0) { |sum, i| sum + Math.sqrt(i) }
end

def io_intensive_task
  sleep(0.1) # Simulate I/O wait
  "IO result"
end

def benchmark_concurrency_patterns
  n = 1000
  tasks = 8

  Benchmark.bm(20) do |x|
    x.report("Sequential") do
      tasks.times { cpu_intensive_task(n) }
    end

    x.report("Threads") do
      threads = tasks.times.map do
        Thread.new { cpu_intensive_task(n) }
      end
      threads.map(&:join)
    end

    x.report("Ractors") do
      ractors = tasks.times.map do
        Ractor.new(n) { |num| cpu_intensive_task(num) }
      end
      ractors.map(&:take)
    end

    x.report("Fibers (IO)") do
      Async do
        tasks.times.map do
          Async { io_intensive_task }
        end.map(&:wait)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Memory Usage Monitoring

```ruby
class MemoryProfiler
  def self.measure(&block)
    GC.start
    memory_before = `ps -o rss= -p #{Process.pid}`.to_i

    result = block.call

    GC.start
    memory_after = `ps -o rss= -p #{Process.pid}`.to_i

    {
      result: result,
      memory_delta: memory_after - memory_before,
      memory_before: memory_before,
      memory_after: memory_after
    }
  end
end

# Usage
profile = MemoryProfiler.measure do
  # Your concurrent code here
  1000.times.map { Thread.new { Array.new(1000) { rand } } }.map(&:join)
end

puts "Memory used: #{profile[:memory_delta]} KB"
```

## Choosing the Right Concurrency Pattern

Selecting the appropriate concurrency mechanism depends on your specific use case:

### Decision Tree for Concurrency Patterns

```ruby
class ConcurrencySelector
  def self.recommend(characteristics)
    case characteristics
    in { type: :io_bound, scale: :high }
      "Use Fiber-based async programming with schedulers"
    in { type: :cpu_bound, isolation: :required }
      "Use Ractors for true parallelism"
    in { type: :mixed, legacy: true }
      "Use Thread pools with careful synchronization"
    in { type: :io_bound, simple: true }
      "Use basic Thread concurrency"
    else
      "Evaluate specific requirements and benchmark"
    end
  end
end

# Usage examples
puts ConcurrencySelector.recommend(type: :io_bound, scale: :high)
# => "Use Fiber-based async programming with schedulers"

puts ConcurrencySelector.recommend(type: :cpu_bound, isolation: :required)
# => "Use Ractors for true parallelism"
```

### Performance Characteristics Comparison

| Pattern | Use Case | GVL Impact | Memory Overhead | Complexity |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Threads | I/O-bound operations | Released during I/O | Medium | Low |
| Fibers | Async I/O, cooperative | Single-threaded | Low | Medium |
| Ractors | CPU-bound, parallel | Bypassed | High | High |
| Sequential | Simple, predictable | N/A | Lowest | Lowest |

## Debugging Concurrent Ruby Code

Concurrent code can be challenging to debug. Here are essential techniques and tools:

### Thread Debugging Techniques

```ruby
class ThreadDebugger
  def self.dump_threads
    Thread.list.each_with_index do |thread, index|
      puts "Thread #{index}: #{thread.inspect}"
      puts "  Status: #{thread.status}"
      puts "  Alive: #{thread.alive?}"
      puts "  Priority: #{thread.priority}"
      puts "  Backtrace:"
      thread.backtrace&.first(5)&.each { |line| puts "    #{line}" }
      puts "---"
    end
  end

  def self.detect_deadlocks
    threads = Thread.list.select(&:alive?)
    blocked_threads = threads.select { |t| t.status == 'sleep' }

    if blocked_threads.size == threads.size - 1 # Minus main thread
      puts "Potential deadlock detected!"
      dump_threads
    end
  end
end

# Usage in debugging
ThreadDebugger.dump_threads
ThreadDebugger.detect_deadlocks
```

### Race Condition Detection

```ruby
class RaceConditionDetector
  def initialize
    @access_log = Concurrent::Array.new
    @mutex = Mutex.new
  end

  def track_access(resource_id, operation)
    @access_log << {
      resource_id: resource_id,
      operation: operation,
      thread_id: Thread.current.object_id,
      timestamp: Time.now.to_f
    }
  end

  def analyze_races
    @mutex.synchronize do
      grouped = @access_log.group_by { |entry| entry[:resource_id] }

      grouped.each do |resource_id, accesses|
        detect_concurrent_writes(resource_id, accesses)
      end
    end
  end

  private

  def detect_concurrent_writes(resource_id, accesses)
    writes = accesses.select { |a| a[:operation] == :write }
                    .sort_by { |a| a[:timestamp] }

    writes.each_cons(2) do |write1, write2|
      time_diff = write2[:timestamp] - write1[:timestamp]
      if time_diff < 0.001 && write1[:thread_id] != write2[:thread_id]
        puts "Race condition detected on #{resource_id}!"
        puts "  Thread #{write1[:thread_id]} wrote at #{write1[:timestamp]}"
        puts "  Thread #{write2[:thread_id]} wrote at #{write2[:timestamp]}"
        puts "  Time difference: #{time_diff * 1000}ms"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Ractor Debugging

```ruby
class RactorMonitor
  def self.monitor_ractors(&block)
    initial_count = Ractor.count
    puts "Starting with #{initial_count} Ractors"

    result = block.call

    final_count = Ractor.count
    puts "Finished with #{final_count} Ractors"

    if final_count > initial_count
      puts "Warning: #{final_count - initial_count} Ractors may not have been cleaned up"
    end

    result
  rescue => e
    puts "Error in Ractor execution: #{e.message}"
    puts "Current Ractor count: #{Ractor.count}"
    raise
  end
end

# Usage
result = RactorMonitor.monitor_ractors do
  # Your Ractor code here
  5.times.map { Ractor.new { sleep(1); 42 } }.map(&:take)
end
```

## Advanced Patterns and Best Practices

### Circuit Breaker Pattern for Concurrent Operations

```ruby
class ConcurrentCircuitBreaker
  def initialize(failure_threshold: 5, timeout: 60)
    @failure_threshold = failure_threshold
    @timeout = timeout
    @failure_count = Concurrent::AtomicFixnum.new(0)
    @last_failure_time = Concurrent::AtomicReference.new(nil)
    @state = Concurrent::AtomicReference.new(:closed)
    @mutex = Mutex.new
  end

  def call(&block)
    case @state.get
    when :open
      check_if_can_retry
      raise CircuitBreakerError, "Circuit breaker is OPEN"
    when :half_open
      execute_with_half_open_logic(&block)
    else
      execute_with_closed_logic(&block)
    end
  end

  private

  def execute_with_closed_logic(&block)
    block.call
  rescue => e
    handle_failure
    raise
  end

  def execute_with_half_open_logic(&block)
    @mutex.synchronize do
      return block.call.tap { handle_success }
    end
  rescue => e
    handle_failure
    raise
  end

  def handle_failure
    count = @failure_count.increment
    @last_failure_time.set(Time.now)

    if count >= @failure_threshold
      @state.set(:open)
    end
  end

  def handle_success
    @failure_count.set(0)
    @state.set(:closed)
  end

  def check_if_can_retry
    last_failure = @last_failure_time.get
    if last_failure && (Time.now - last_failure) > @timeout
      @state.set(:half_open)
    end
  end
end

class CircuitBreakerError < StandardError; end
```

### Rate Limiting with Concurrency

```ruby
class ConcurrentRateLimiter
  def initialize(max_requests, window_seconds)
    @max_requests = max_requests
    @window_seconds = window_seconds
    @requests = Concurrent::Array.new
    @mutex = Mutex.new
  end

  def acquire
    @mutex.synchronize do
      now = Time.now
      @requests.reject! { |timestamp| now - timestamp > @window_seconds }

      if @requests.size >= @max_requests
        raise RateLimitError, "Rate limit exceeded"
      end

      @requests << now
      true
    end
  end

  def with_rate_limit(&block)
    acquire
    block.call
  end
end

class RateLimitError < StandardError; end

# Usage with concurrent operations
limiter = ConcurrentRateLimiter.new(10, 60) # 10 requests per minute

threads = 20.times.map do |i|
  Thread.new do
    begin
      limiter.with_rate_limit do
        puts "Request #{i} executed at #{Time.now}"
        # Your API call here
      end
    rescue RateLimitError => e
      puts "Request #{i} blocked: #{e.message}"
    end
  end
end

threads.each(&:join)
```

## Real-World Application Examples

Implementing concurrent systems in production requires careful consideration of architecture, monitoring, and error handling. The examples below demonstrate battle-tested patterns we've successfully deployed in various client applications. Our [Ruby on Rails development team](/services/app-web-development/) has implemented these concurrency patterns in production environments, helping clients achieve 3-5x performance improvements while maintaining system reliability and reducing infrastructure costs.

### Web Scraping with Mixed Concurrency

```ruby
class ConcurrentWebScraper
  def initialize
    @http_client = initialize_http_client
    @rate_limiter = ConcurrentRateLimiter.new(10, 1)
    @thread_pool = ThreadPool.new(8)
  end

  def scrape_urls(urls)
    results = Concurrent::Array.new

    urls.each do |url|
      @thread_pool.schedule do
        begin
          @rate_limiter.with_rate_limit do
            content = fetch_content(url)
            parsed = parse_content(content)
            results << { url: url, data: parsed }
          end
        rescue => e
          results << { url: url, error: e.message }
        end
      end
    end

    @thread_pool.shutdown
    results.to_a
  end

  private

  def initialize_http_client
    # Initialize your HTTP client here
    # Example: Net::HTTP, HTTParty, Faraday, etc.
  end

  def fetch_content(url)
    # Implement HTTP fetching with retries
    retries = 3
    begin
      @http_client.get(url)
    rescue => e
      retries -= 1
      retry if retries > 0
      raise
    end
  end

  def parse_content(content)
    # Implement your parsing logic
    # Example: Nokogiri, JSON parsing, etc.
  end
end
```

### Background Job Processing System

```ruby
class ConcurrentJobProcessor
  def initialize(worker_count: 4)
    @job_queue = Queue.new
    @result_store = Concurrent::Hash.new
    @workers = start_workers(worker_count)
    @shutdown = false
  end

  def enqueue(job_id, job_data)
    return false if @shutdown
    @job_queue << { id: job_id, data: job_data }
    true
  end

  def get_result(job_id, timeout: 30)
    start_time = Time.now

    loop do
      return @result_store[job_id] if @result_store.key?(job_id)
      return nil if Time.now - start_time > timeout
      sleep(0.1)
    end
  end

  def shutdown
    @shutdown = true
    @workers.size.times { @job_queue << :shutdown }
    @workers.each(&:join)
  end

  def status
    {
      queue_size: @job_queue.size,
      completed_jobs: @result_store.size,
      active_workers: @workers.count(&:alive?)
    }
  end

  private

  def start_workers(count)
    count.times.map do |worker_id|
      Thread.new do
        loop do
          job = @job_queue.pop
          break if job == :shutdown

          process_job(worker_id, job)
        end
      end
    end
  end

  def process_job(worker_id, job)
    puts "Worker #{worker_id} processing job #{job[:id]}"

    result = perform_work(job[:data])
    @result_store[job[:id]] = {
      result: result,
      completed_at: Time.now,
      worker_id: worker_id
    }
  rescue => e
    @result_store[job[:id]] = {
      error: e.message,
      failed_at: Time.now,
      worker_id: worker_id
    }
  end

  def perform_work(job_data)
    # Implement your actual job processing here
    sleep(rand(1.0..3.0)) # Simulate variable work time
    "Processed: #{job_data}"
  end
end
```

## Conclusion

Ruby's concurrency landscape in 2025 offers powerful tools for building high-performance applications. Understanding when to use threads for I/O-bound operations, fibers for cooperative concurrency, and Ractors for CPU-intensive parallel processing is key to success.
