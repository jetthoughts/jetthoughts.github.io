# FAQ Schema for featured snippets
faqs:
  - question: "What's the main difference between a fractional CTO and full-time CTO?"
    answer: "A fractional CTO provides part-time strategic technical leadership at 60-80% cost savings compared to full-time CTOs. Full-time CTOs offer dedicated focus and availability but require $350K-$650K annually plus equity, while fractional CTOs work 10-30 hours per week for $60K-$300K yearly, providing the same expertise without full-time commitment."
  - question: "When should I hire a fractional CTO instead of full-time?"
    answer: "Hire a fractional CTO when you're a startup or small business (under 50 employees), need technical strategy but not daily oversight, have budget constraints, require specific expertise for projects, or are in transition periods. Full-time CTOs are better for scaling companies with large teams (50+ developers) requiring constant technical leadership."
  - question: "How much money can I save with a fractional CTO?"
    answer: "Companies typically save 60-80% compared to full-time CTO costs. A fractional CTO costs $60K-$300K annually while full-time CTOs require $350K-$650K plus equity (20-30% increase in total compensation). For a 20-hour weekly engagement, you get senior CTO expertise at fraction of the cost."
  - question: "What are the main disadvantages of hiring a fractional CTO?"
    answer: "Fractional CTO limitations include limited availability (10-30 hours/week), shared attention across multiple clients, potential communication delays, less company culture immersion, and may not be suitable for companies needing constant technical oversight or managing large development teams (50+ people)."
  - question: "Can a fractional CTO help with fundraising and investor relations?"
    answer: "Yes, experienced fractional CTOs excel at investor relations, technical due diligence, and fundraising preparation. They create compelling technical roadmaps, demonstrate product scalability, and communicate technology strategy to investors - often providing more credibility than internal team members due to their external perspective and proven track record."
