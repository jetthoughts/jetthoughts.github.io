This article talks about the big chance for startups in open source AI. Just like RedHat and GitLab built big companies from open source projects, we see a similar path for AI. We are looking for companies that build around open source AI models like DeepSeek and Llama. There is a real need for support and services to help businesses use these AI tools.

## The Open Source AI Opportunity

We want to fund enterprise open source AI. Think about how things changed before. First, we had proprietary Unix. Then came Linux, and after that, Red Hat. Red Hat built a huge business by offering support for Linux.

Another example is BitKeeper. Then we got Git, and that led to GitHub and GitLab. These companies made a lot of money by helping people use open source tools.

We think there is a huge chance to build startups that offer support and services for open source AI. Many organizations that release open source code do not want to focus on giving commercial support. For example, Google and Facebook open source many tools. But they do not seem excited about giving commercial support for all businesses that want to use them. This creates a chance for startups.

## Why Open Source AI?

Many winners will come from open source AI. With DeepSeek launching, there is a lot of new ground for founders to cover. They can help businesses use these systems. If you want to build an open source AI for the enterprise, we want to hear from you.
