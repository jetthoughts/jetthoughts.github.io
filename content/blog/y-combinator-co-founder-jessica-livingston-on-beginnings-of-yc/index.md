[![Y Combinator Co-Founder Jessica Livingston on the Beginnings of YC](file_0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywdFD0cAq2E)

In the early days of startup culture, there was a significant gap in funding options for entrepreneurs. Jessica Livingston, co-founder of Y Combinator, shares insights into how YC was born out of necessity, aiming to fill that void for early-stage startups.

### Key Takeaways

*   Y Combinator was created to support early-stage startups.
*   The funding landscape in 2005 was limited, especially in Boston.
*   YC aimed to provide small checks to help founders test their ideas.

### The Need For Early-Stage Funding

Back in 2005, the startup scene was quite different. If you wanted funding, you had two main options: venture capitalists or random angels. Venture capitalists were looking for businesses that were already somewhat established. They wanted business plans and tested ideas. On the other hand, there weren't many angel investors around, and small seed funds were practically non-existent.

This left a lot of budding entrepreneurs in a tough spot. They had ideas but lacked the means to explore them. Jessica and her team recognized this gap and thought, "Hey, we can do something about this!"

### The Birth of Y Combinator

So, they set out to create a new kind of funding model. The goal was simple: provide a small amount of money to help founders quit their day jobs, pay their rent, and start testing their ideas. This was revolutionary at the time. Instead of needing a fully fleshed-out business plan, founders could come in with just a concept and get the support they needed to see if it could work.

### How Y Combinator Works

Y Combinator operates on a straightforward model:

1.  **Application**: Startups apply to be part of the program.
2.  **Funding**: Selected startups receive a small amount of funding.
3.  **Mentorship**: Founders get guidance from experienced mentors.
4.  **Demo Day**: After a few months, startups present their progress to investors.

This model has helped countless startups get off the ground. It’s not just about the money; it’s about the support and community that comes with it.

### The Impact of Y Combinator

Since its inception, Y Combinator has funded thousands of startups. Some of the most well-known companies today, like Airbnb and Dropbox, got their start through YC. The impact of this funding model has been profound, changing how startups approach funding and growth.

### Conclusion

Jessica Livingston’s vision for Y Combinator was to create a space where early-stage founders could find the support they desperately needed. By filling the funding gap, YC has not only helped individual startups but has also contributed to the growth of the entire startup ecosystem. Today, it stands as a testament to the power of innovation and community in entrepreneurship.
