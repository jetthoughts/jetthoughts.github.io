[![YC Partner and Algolia Co-Founder Nicolas Dessaigne’s Advice for Founders Starting Out](file_0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSOIoVHKkI)

Starting a business can feel overwhelming. You might think you need the perfect idea before you even begin. But according to Nicolas Dessaigne, co-founder of Algolia and a partner at Y Combinator, that’s not the case. He emphasizes the importance of starting now, even if your idea isn’t fully formed. The journey of building your product is where the real learning happens.

### Key Takeaways

*   Don’t wait for the perfect idea; start building now.
*   Focus on fast iterations and learning from users.
*   Engage with your users directly; their feedback is gold.
*   Launch early, even if your product isn’t perfect.

### Start Building Now

Many founders get stuck in the idea phase. They think they need everything figured out before they can start. But Dessaigne argues that this is a trap. **You don’t need a perfect idea to begin.** Instead, just start building. As you create your product, you’ll learn what works and what doesn’t. This process will lead you to better ideas.

### Fast Iteration Is Key

Once you start, don’t overthink it. Build quickly and keep your iterations fast. This means you should be okay with creating something that’s not perfect. In the early stages, it’s all about learning. **Crappy and quick is fine.** You can always refine and improve later. The goal is to keep moving forward and learning from your mistakes.

### Spend Time With Your Users

One of the best ways to learn is to talk to your users. Dessaigne stresses the importance of spending time with them. **Go to their offices, have conversations, and really listen.** This direct feedback is invaluable. You can’t build a product that meets their needs if you don’t understand them.

### Do Things That Don’t Scale

In the beginning, focus on what you can do to connect with your users, even if it seems small or unscalable. This might mean doing things manually or personally reaching out to customers. These efforts can lead to insights that help shape your product. **Don’t shy away from these early interactions.** They can guide you in the right direction.

### Launch Early

Finally, don’t be afraid to launch your product early. Many founders worry about what will happen if their product fails. But Dessaigne reminds us that **people won’t remember if it doesn’t work out.** What matters is the feedback you get. Launching early allows you to gather insights that can help you improve your product.

In conclusion, starting a business is a journey. Don’t wait for the perfect moment. Build, learn, and iterate. Engage with your users and launch early. This approach will help you create a product that truly meets the needs of your audience. So, get out there and start building!
