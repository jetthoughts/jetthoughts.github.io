*We offer a 2-week trial with no obligation. So you can test everything and see how it goes with no financial risks at all. Let’s see how it works…*

##**What is the trial period?**##
The Trial period is primarily designed to test out whether new employees are a good fit for the business and allow both employer and employee to start an employment relationship.
This means that you try out JetThoughts’ service and get a better idea of how we work. The trial period is generally taken up to two weeks, this is enough time to confirm the engagement will be successful.

##**Why do we use the Trial period?**##
Nowadays, everyone uses different advertising tools and it’s hard to choose the one from all the companies that can really help. The trial period helps employers to be sure they’ve made the right recruiting decision and don’t regret it.
Moreover, employers can use the trial period to evaluate the performance, skills, and abilities of our team members.
This reduces the expense of continuing to employ someone who is unsuitable for the job and enables them to be replaced more swiftly.

##**How does the Trial period work?**##
If you’re completely satisfied with the results, we’ll ask for the first payment (for the time) and request to continue the engagement for as long as you’d like. Next to the trial period if both parts are comfortable with each other, you’ll get bi-weekly invoices to pay.

If you’re not completely satisfied, you won’t be billed. From there, we can either part ways, or we can provide you with another member of our team who may be a better fit and with whom we will begin a second, no-risk trial.

We understand that sometimes you can actually really forget about the ending of the Trial period. That’s why you’ll get a notification in two days before ending.

Given the potential pitfalls, if you are considering using the Trial period with us for your next hire, feel free to contact us and discuss further.
