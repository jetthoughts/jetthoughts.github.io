Understanding how a candidate plans to work is crucial when hiring remote workers. Have you ever encountered a candidate who hesitates to share their work methods, perhaps citing:

> I'm not a free consultant

While it may sound witty, it's a red flag. Here's why.

Fear of Intellectual Theft? Not a Valid Excuse
----------------------------------------------

1.  **Standard Methods**: Most strategies are out there for all to see. They're not secrets. If candidates fear sharing, they may not know the methods at all.
2.  **Prove Your Worth**: Sharing ideas shows they know their stuff. Why trust them to do it if they can't explain what they will do?

Personal Traits? Not a Good Reason
----------------------------------

1.  **Team Player Needed**: How will they work with your team if they won't share now? You need someone who can explain their work clearly.
2.  **Openness Matters**: A good worker should be open and transparent. Hidden methods mean hidden problems later.

Creating Trust in Interviews
----------------------------

1.  **Open Discussion**: Good candidates talk freely about their work. It shows they trust you and understand your needs.
2.  **Show Their Skills**: When they share, they show their skills. They prove they can turn plans into reality.

Conclusion: Look for Openness
-----------------------------

Don't ignore the red flags. A great candidate shares their methods. They show they are ready to work with you. They prove they can get the job done. Keep this in mind when you hire. By prioritizing open and transparent people, you can take control of your hiring process and ensure the best fit for your team.

> Hiring the right person is vital. Ensure they show you how they will work and prove they know. This is not just about their methods but their ability to turn their plans into reality, giving you confidence in your hiring decisions.
