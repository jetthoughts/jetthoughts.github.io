There are moments when you’re full of motivation, ideas come up with your mind and straight onto the page. But there are other moments when you take up hours of your time, before getting to that last sentence. You’re almost about giving up.

It’s time to write creating content. But not just any content. We’re talking creative, suitable and interesting content that actually gets read. And that’s exactly what you’ll get in this article.

Use these specific formulas that you can plug-and-play to craft your blog posts in under an hour.

Let’s get to it.

## Step #1 — The Power of Headlines

The headline has the ability to make or break a blog post. It impacts how (and if) it’s found in search engines and social bookmarking sites, it influences whether people visit your blog in News Readers, it affects whether people leave a comment and is vital in whether people actually read what you have to say.

## Step #2 — Build an idea bank

Use these questions to brainstorm, and add the answers to them. You can then use the headline formulas that I’ll be giving you to craft a custom headline.

Questions to use when considering your products/services:

* What’s the urgency?

* Why is your product relevant now?

* Why is your product the #1 solution?

Then, audit your popular blog content. The best way to know what content will delight your audience is to pinpoint blog posts that have already hit the mark.

Get in tune with the desires and pain points of your target audience. It’s to get into the heads and hearts of your audience. Here’s where you can get that insight:

* Blog comments

* Quora

* Facebook groups

## Step #3 — The Importance of Being Original

People are drawn to others who speak their minds, who have something unique to say and who say it in a creative and fresh way. Say what everyone else is saying in the same way that everyone else is saying it and you’re almost guaranteed of being largely ignored.

Few extra principles to be more original:

* **Credibility** — Your readers need to believe in their own ability to produce results. That’s where providing easily consumable and actionable content will come into play.

* **Urgency** — You need to help your readers get over their tendency to procrastinate. The way to do that is to emphasize the urgency. Why does the information in your blog post matter today?

* **Authority** — the more authority you command, the more people will bet on you to deliver the transformation that they seek.

## Step #4 — The Value of Scannable Content

Online readers tend to scan content. As a result, if you place visual cues in your posts that draw the eye to important points you’ll find people stick with you longer into your posts.

## Step #5 — Shortness is the key

Use short sentences, short paragraphs, and short posts. Never write more than two pages on any subject. Over time, try to write less, not more. In general, shorten everything.

*Note: short does not mean that your writing can’t be stylistic and intelligent. Short means simple and understandable.*

## Step #6 — Show, don’t tell

Show, don’t tell is a technique used in various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through action, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author’s exposition, summarization, and description.

It avoids adjectives describing the author’s analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions.

## Step #7 — Great Visual

Another simple technique for providing an additional point of interest in your posts is to provide something visual.

Don’t use images in every chapter, but add a few suitable pictures and screenshots in your article, it always increases reader attention. Images have the power to communicate in ways that words cannot — use them.

## Conclusion

Even if you’re a self-proclaimed terrible writer or hate the writing process, you still can create the persuasive content of an article without consuming days of your time.

What it takes is commitment and trust in the systems that have already been proven to generate results.

Good luck!
