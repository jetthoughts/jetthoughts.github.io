**Work whenever you want? — No problems!**

Free schedule is one of the main pros of working as a freelancer, it’s a great opportunity to improve a person’s standard of living. You will feel absolute freedom when you’re able to manage your time on your own: take a day off in the middle of the week, finish work when you need it, find a last-minute vacation and organize a vacation in a week. You set your own tempo and do as much work as you can without weariness and burnout.

**Work wherever you want? — You’re welcome!**

Working remotely seems like a dream to many people. But this is not a dream, this is the absolute reality! Freelancers don’t need to be at a particular place at all: you can work from home, the countryside, or even from a sunny beach. You also have the opportunity to stay in your pajamas all day, put your cat next to you, take various snacks and enjoy your life even during the work process. No boring offices, people who are always distracting, traffic jams on your way to work and so on.

**Work directly with the customer? — Sure you can!**

Direct communication with clients allows you to make promising acquaintances around the world. This will help you to move quicker to the international level and gain first-class knowledge from people who are experts in their field, as well as improve your English level. That’s why communication with such people will definitely improve your skills and abilities.

**Manage your own process? — Everything’s in your hands!**

When you work as a freelancer, you learn one of the best values ​​of a truly loved job — freedom. You always have the right to choose which clients you are comfortable working with and which you’re not, decide which projects are interesting to you and which ones you don’t want to implement. You can try different tasks, technologies, projects from different fields, and then choose what is really yours. This is a great opportunity for self-development and professional growth. In addition, you no longer have to report every step to anyone, the only thing you should do is give a valuable result to the client.

**Choose the amount of your income? — Why not!**

It’s not a secret that freelancers get higher salaries than the same specialists inside the companies. That’s because you indicate the rate that you consider you deserve for your work. Moreover, you don’t need to wait for a raise from your employer, because you can raise your rate by yourself when you feel that you’ve reached a new level in your knowledge.

**Work not because you need to, but because you want to? — Even this is possible!**

In conclusion, it’s important to say that all the benefits listed earlier, despite the already huge number of advantages, have one more great result: you can really enjoy the balance between life and work. This allows you to spend more time with your family, travel even without vacations, have a healthy sleep and plan your work hours based on your productive hours of the day. You’ll have the opportunity to achieve your dream life as never before.
