In the early stages of a startup, founders often find themselves at a crossroads when it comes to sales. While it may seem tempting to hire experienced salespeople to drive revenue, the reality is that founders are uniquely positioned to sell their own products, especially before achieving product-market fit (PMF).

### Key Takeaways

*   Founders are often the best salespeople for their products.
*   Sales before product-market fit requires a unique skill set.
*   Hiring salespeople too early can lead to misalignment and wasted resources.

### The Unique Role of Founders in Sales

When you're building a product that you hope other businesses will buy, the good news is that **you are capable of selling it**. However, the bad news is that you might be the only person who can effectively sell your product at the beginning. If you can't sell your product yourself, it’s unlikely that you will find someone else who can.

### The Temptation to Hire Sales Talent

Many founders think about hiring talented salespeople to accelerate growth. After all, this is a common approach for other roles like designers, lawyers, or accountants. However, the dynamics of sales change significantly before achieving product-market fit.

### Why Sales Pre-PMF Is Different

Sales before PMF is fundamentally different from sales after PMF. Here are some reasons why:

1.  **Entrepreneurial Mindset**: Selling a product that hasn’t yet found its market requires a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Founders need to be visionaries who can articulate the value of their product.
2.  **Credibility with Customers**: As a founder, you have a personal stake in the product. This credibility can resonate with potential customers, making them more likely to trust you.
3.  **Experimentation**: Early sales efforts often involve a lot of trial and error. Founders are in the best position to experiment with different approaches and learn from customer feedback.
4.  **Tight Feedback Loop**: Founders can maintain a close relationship with the product development team, allowing for rapid adjustments based on customer insights.

### The Risks of Hiring Early

Hiring salespeople too early can lead to several pitfalls:

*   **Misalignment**: Salespeople may not fully understand the product or its value proposition, leading to miscommunication with potential customers.
*   **Wasted Resources**: Investing in a sales team before achieving PMF can drain resources that could be better spent on product development.
*   **Loss of Control**: Founders may lose touch with customer needs and feedback, which are crucial for refining the product.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while it may be tempting to hire experienced salespeople to drive early revenue, founders are often the best equipped to sell their products before achieving product-market fit. By embracing the sales process themselves, founders can ensure that they maintain a close connection with their customers, gather valuable feedback, and ultimately drive their startup toward success. **Sales pre-PMF is not just a task; it’s a critical part of the entrepreneurial journey.**
