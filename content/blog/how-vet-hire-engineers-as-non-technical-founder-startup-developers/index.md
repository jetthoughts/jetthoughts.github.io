You don't need an in-house tech expert to find the right developer. Follow these steps to get the best help.

## 1. Write Down Your Idea

Write what you want to build. Please keep it simple! Describe the problem and how your product solves it. Refer to [Geoffry Moore's “vision of the product”](https://martinfowler.com/articles/lean-inception/write-product-vision.html).

## 2. (Optional) Get a Tech Advisor

Find a senior tech lead or a part-time CTO. They can help you hire the right developer.

This is the best option. It is even cheaper and safer than hiring a development agency (dev shop). They know what to look for in a good developer and can guide you through the process.

Learn about the benefits of a [Fractional CTO](https://jetthoughts.com/services/fractional-cto/). See how to [recruit one at zero cost](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/recruit-fractional-cto-zero-cost-jetthoughts-mow1f/).

## 3. Hire Two Part-Time Developers

Hire two part-time developers instead of one full-time. They can check each other's work, keeping them honest and productive.

## 4. Look for Specific Skills

Search for developers who use [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). They write tests first, then code.

Find those who have set up [Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD). They can update your product with speed and safety. To understand the importance of TDD, read [Why and How to Use TDD: Main Tips for Testing](https://jetthoughts.com/blog/why-how-use-tdd-main-tips-testing/).

Look for developers from countries that win programming competitions: Eastern European countries, China, the United States, South Korea, and India.

## 5. Find managers of one

Look for developers who have worked directly with founders. These people know how to communicate with non-tech people and provide great empathy. Learn more on [Basecamp Blog: Hire managers of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one).

## 6. Use Lean Startup

Learn about Lean Startup principles. First, build a simple version of your product. Test it with users. Improve based on feedback.

## 7. Empower Your Team

Empower your team to create solutions. Make them accountable through Impact Mapping. This helps align their work with your business goals. Read about [Aligning Remote Teams with OKRs and Impact Mapping](https://jetthoughts.com/blog/align-remote-teams-with-okrs-impact-mapping-management-devops/).

## 8. Set Up a Transparent Process

Use Kanban boards to track progress. This lets you see what developers are doing without managing them. For more on managing remote teams, read [Kanban for Distributed Teams](https://jetthoughts.com/blog/delivery-flow-for-distributed-remote-teams-agile-kanban/).

Learn about Work-In-Progress (WIP) limits to keep tasks manageable. Discover how WIP limits improve productivity in [this article](https://jetthoughts.com/blog/how-wip-limits-improves-effectiveness-productivity-management/).

## 9. Keep Communication Open

Confirm that developers will provide daily asynchronous text updates. This keeps everyone on the same page. For tips on effective communication, check out [How to Make Small Valuable Async Standups](https://jetthoughts.com/blog/how-make-small-valuable-async-standups-productivity-development/).

## 10. Protect Your Interests

Use contracts that cover clear termination terms and deliverables. To protect your business, include clauses on non-compete and no soliciting.

## 11. Run a 2-week trial project

The interview does not provide real experience. Running a paid 2-week trial project is a great solution to confirm a match. [Some staffing agencies offer free trials](https://jetthoughts.com/blog/trial-period-for-staff-augmentation-in-jetthoughts-startup-engagement/).
