AI agents are here. They are not just helpers. They make their own choices. They can do tasks humans do, sometimes even better. We think these agents will be everywhere. They will help us in our jobs and daily lives. Imagine having a team of AI agents. They work for you, making you more productive and creative. We want to help this future happen.

## The Rise of AI Agents

For the last two years, we have seen many new companies use AI to change old ways of doing things. Now, we see something new: AI agents. These agents do more than just help people. They can make choices on their own. With new AI models, these agents are getting much better at thinking. This means they can do tasks that humans do. They can even make these tasks better.

We believe AI agents will be common everywhere. They will be in all parts of our lives. Think about a world where everyone has their own team of AI agents. These agents work quietly. They make people more productive and creative.

## Building Blocks for AI Agents

To make this future happen faster, we are looking for companies that build tools for AI agents. These tools can be:

*   **AI Builders**: These companies help customers make and use their own custom agents easily. Examples are Wordware or Stack AI.
*   **Agent Building Blocks**: These are tools, APIs, or platforms. They make agents better. They let agents do more complex things. They help agents have a bigger impact.

### Key Takeaways

*   AI agents are the next big thing in AI.
*   They can make decisions on their own.
*   They can do human tasks, and sometimes improve them.
*   We are looking for companies that build tools for these agents.

If you are building in this area, we want to hear from you. We want to help you shape the future of software.
