Starting a business can feel overwhelming. Nicolas Dessaigne, co-founder of Algolia and a partner at Y Combinator, shares practical advice for founders just starting out. His insights focus on the importance of action over perfection and learning from users.

### Key Takeaways

*   Don’t wait for the perfect idea; start building now.
*   Focus on fast iterations and learning from users.
*   Launch early and gather feedback.
*   Spend time with your users to understand their needs.

### Start Building Now

Many new founders get stuck waiting for that **perfect idea**. But here’s the truth: it doesn’t exist. Instead of waiting, just start building. Even if your idea isn’t perfect, you’ll learn a lot as you go. The process of creating your product will lead you to better ideas.

### Fast Iteration Is Key

When you’re building, don’t overthink it. **Build quickly** and keep your iterations fast. This means you should be okay with creating something that’s not perfect. Early on, it’s all about learning from your users. You want to find out what works and what doesn’t.

*   **Quick and Dirty**: It’s fine to have a rough version of your product. You can always refine it later.
*   **Refactor What Matters**: Once you learn what your users need, focus on improving those aspects of your product.

### Engage With Your Users

You can’t learn if you don’t talk to your users. Spend time with them. Go to their offices, have conversations, and really understand their needs. This is where you’ll get the best insights.

*   **Do Things That Don’t Scale**: Early on, it’s okay to do things that might not be efficient. Personal interactions can lead to valuable feedback.
*   **Launch Early**: Don’t be afraid to put your product out there. You might think it’s not ready, but launching early can provide you with feedback that’s crucial for your growth.

### The Fear of Failure

Many founders worry about what will happen if their product fails. But here’s a comforting thought: people won’t remember if it doesn’t work out. What matters is the feedback you gather. This feedback can guide you to create a product that truly meets your users' needs.

### Conclusion

In the end, the best advice is simple: **start now**. Don’t wait for the perfect moment or the perfect idea. Build, learn, and adapt. Your journey as a founder is just beginning, and every step you take will lead you closer to success. So, roll up your sleeves and get to work!
