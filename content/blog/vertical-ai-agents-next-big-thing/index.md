As the tech world evolves, vertical AI agents are emerging as a game-changer. These agents promise to replace entire teams and functions in enterprises, creating a new wave of startups. In this blog post, we explore the potential of vertical AI agents and their impact on the SaaS landscape.

### Key Takeaways

*   Vertical AI agents could create $300 billion companies.
*   The rise of competition in AI is beneficial for consumers and founders.
*   Historical parallels between SaaS and vertical AI agents.
*   The importance of identifying repetitive tasks for AI solutions.

### The Rise of Vertical AI Agents

Every few months, advancements in AI have been remarkable. We are now discussing **vertical AI agents** that can take over entire teams in businesses. This shift is mind-blowing. Previously, there was a dominant player in AI, but now competition is heating up. This competition is essential for a healthy market where consumers have choices and founders can thrive.

### SaaS vs. Vertical AI

To understand the potential of vertical AI agents, we can look at the history of SaaS (Software as a Service). For the last two decades, SaaS has dominated the startup scene, accounting for over 40% of venture capital funding. This has led to the creation of more than 300 SaaS unicorns.

The key to SaaS's success was the **XML HTTP request**, which allowed developers to create rich internet applications. This technology transformed software from something you installed on your computer to something you accessed online. Similarly, vertical AI agents are set to revolutionize how businesses operate by integrating AI into their workflows.

### The Three Buckets of Startup Ideas

When looking at the startup landscape, we can categorize ideas into three buckets:

1.  **Obvious Good Ideas**: These are consumer products like email and chat. Most of the value in these categories went to incumbents like Google and Facebook.
2.  **Unexpected Ideas**: These are innovative concepts that no one saw coming, like Uber and Airbnb. Startups thrived here because incumbents were slow to react.
3.  **B2B SaaS Companies**: This is where most billion-dollar companies emerged. There was no single dominant player in this space, allowing many startups to flourish.

### Why Incumbents Missed B2B SaaS

One reason big companies didn't dive into B2B SaaS is that each solution requires deep domain knowledge. For example, a company like Google might not have the expertise to build a payroll solution like Gusto. This gap has allowed smaller, specialized companies to thrive.

### The Future of Vertical AI

Vertical AI agents are not just about replacing existing software; they can also reduce the need for large teams. Many companies spend more on payroll than on software. By automating repetitive tasks, vertical AI agents can create leaner organizations.

Imagine a company that previously needed 100 employees for data entry now only requires 10 because of AI. This shift could lead to vertical AI companies being ten times larger than their SaaS counterparts.

### Real-World Examples of Vertical AI

Several startups are already making waves in the vertical AI space:

*   **Outset**: This company is using AI to enhance survey tools, making it easier for businesses to understand customer feedback.
*   **Mtic**: Focused on QA testing, this startup is automating processes that traditionally required a full QA team.
*   **Salient**: This company is automating voice calls for debt collection, reducing the need for call center staff.

These examples show how vertical AI can streamline operations and create new efficiencies.

### Finding Your Vertical

If you're a founder looking to tap into the vertical AI market, focus on **boring, repetitive tasks**. These tasks are often overlooked but can be automated effectively. Look for areas where you have personal experience or connections. This insight can lead to innovative solutions that meet real needs.

### Conclusion

Vertical AI agents are set to transform the tech landscape, much like SaaS did in the past. By automating repetitive tasks and streamlining operations, these agents could create a new wave of billion-dollar companies. As competition in AI continues to grow, the opportunities for founders are vast. Keep an eye on this space; the future is bright for vertical AI!
