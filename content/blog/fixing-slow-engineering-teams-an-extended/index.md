**TL;DR** — Series A companies often stall out after product‑market fit: deadlines slip, vendor hand‑offs pile up, and technical debt snowballs. In **60 days** you can reverse those trends with five proven moves: cross‑functional squads, Shape Up cycles, Kanban flow, TDD, and automated CI/CD.  This guide breaks down the “why” and “how,” bolstered by real metrics, third‑party studies, and a week‑by‑week rollout map.

> **Quick wins:** Most pilots move from **monthly releases** to **daily automated deploys** in under eight weeks, slice defect rates nearly in half, and reclaim multiple developer‑months per quarter — all without adding headcount.
