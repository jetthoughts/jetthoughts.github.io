*Nowadays, remote work gains more and more prominence. Many successful companies let their employees work from home and even prefer hiring people who don’t need an office and love working home. But why?*

*What benefits could you get from this type of work? Is it worth leaving your office?*

## 1. Flexible schedule

The flexible schedule allows employees to work when they accomplish most and enjoy working. If you are an early bird feel free to work with sunrise, but if you are a night owl, don’t push yourself to work in the morning, much better for you to do that in the evening.

Moreover, people have their own activities: language courses or other classes, doctor appointments, need to pick up children from school, etc. So, you can easily make your schedule more convenient and pleasant for yourself!

Besides, if you have children, you will try to make your hours fit around their schedule: you work early in the morning, take a break in the afternoon to pick up your kids after school or kindergarten, and then resume work later in the evening. Or perhaps you just want time to see your son’s games or your daughter’s graduation, and you need the flexibility to manipulate your work schedule without taking a day off.

## 2. Cozy environment

You can choose a workspace on your own. Don’t need to get up and be in a hurry to your office center, sit in an uncomfortable chair, and think about smooth and mellow coffee in the crowded and depressing office.

Take your laptop and come to some cozy restaurant with adorable interior and tasty dishes. Besides, if the weather is awful and you don’t want to go out from home, just stay at home at a warm bed with hot tea and your tablet or laptop.

And one more remarkable thing is that you can travel and work at the same time! Be at the airport, train or even bus. All that you need are a laptop, wi-fi, and headphones. Furthermore, when you want to spend time near the ocean or hit the beach in other countries, don’t need to take a vacation or days off. Come up with your schedule and make it comfortable for work and rest!

## 3. Save money

If you go to the office every day, you need to dress professionally. So, you should invest in clothes that can cost you quite a bit.

But it does not end here, and you will also have to spend money on travel expenses. A bus, cab or own car… isn’t it? Furthermore, time is also wasted when you have to go all the way to your workplace, and this is even more bothersome if your office is located far away.

You can also take into account the expenses of eating out on lunch breaks. It is expensive if you work in a city or downtown. Nonetheless, at home, you can save money by going to the store and preparing food by yourself.

## 4. Fewer distractions

You have an opportunity to avoid co-workers debating the merits of their cars, gossips which is all the time around you and sirens wailing outside your window. Somebody or something wants you to be interrupted or distracted from work.

All these unnecessary meetings or just chatting with colleagues instead of work does not pass against you. All this stuff is a stress for you. Removed from the stresses and distractions of the workplace and working independently in your preferred environment at your own pace, professionals are often a lot happier and a lot more productive.

## 5. Time for family

The time you spend commuting can now be spent with your family. For many, the physical proximity to family and the convenience of being at home are comforting. For parents, it can be especially safe to know that they are near to their children, and available should they be needed for any reason. This also applies in the case of elderly members. They do know, and they can rely on you if the help is needed.

Those working in offices find it difficult to steal out time for their loved ones. It’s evident that weekends are there for sure, but sometimes people need to spend their days off on the other things. However, as you are working from home itself, you have your family around you, and during the breaks, you take, you can just go and spend some quality time with them.
