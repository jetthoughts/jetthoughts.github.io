Understanding the Role
----------------------

A Ruby on Rails developer handles everything from building applications to maintaining them. Key skills include:

-   **Ruby, JavaScript:** The core languages.
-   **Hotwire, Turbo, Stimulus:** For interactive applications.
-   **Linux, Bash, SSH:** Essential for server management.
-   **PAAS (e.g., Heroku, Fly.io):** For deployment.
-   **Self-organized:** They should manage their tasks.

### Manager of One

In startups, developers must embody the 'Manager of One' concept. This means they work independently, make decisions, and drive tasks to completion without constant supervision. Understanding and preparing for this independent nature of the role will make you feel more confident in your hiring process.

Sourcing Candidates
-------------------

Finding top talent can be tricky, but here's where to start:

-   **Reddit:** Engage with communities like r/ruby or r/webdev.
-   **Wellfound Job Board:** A great platform for startups.
-   **Avoid agencies and pre-vetted networks:** They often don't understand your unique needs.

Interviewing
------------

Interviewing is crucial. Here's how to nail it.

### Technical Questions

Focus on non-trivial problems they've solved.

1. Can you describe a particularly challenging technical problem you encountered and how you solved it? (Score: 1-5)
2. What is the most complex project you have worked on, and what was your role? (Score: 1-5)

### Non-Technical Questions

Look for passion, clear communication, and trustworthiness.

1. What motivates you to work in this field? (Score: 1-5)
2. How do you handle communication in a team, especially during conflicts? (Score: 1-5)

### Manager of One

Confirm they can work independently.

1. Can you describe when you managed a project or task alone? How did you ensure its success? (Score: 1-5)

### Scoring System

- **2: Fair** - Provided some relevant information but lacked depth

- **3: Good** - Answered the question with sufficient detail

- **4: Very Good** - Answered thoroughly with clear and relevant examples

- **5: Excellent** - Provided exceptional detail and insight, demonstrating strong capability

Evaluating Candidates
---------------------

Here's how to assess candidates:

-   **Test Project:** Send a 2-hour test project in PHP or Python. This will reveal your adaptability and problem-solving skills.
-   **Peer Review:** Have other developers (you can hire per task) evaluate their work.
-   **Incentive:** Offer an Amazon gift card for their effort.

2-Week Trial
------------

A trial period is invaluable. Here's how to set it up:

-   **Immediate Start:** Ensure they can begin coding on day one.
-   **Daily Updates:** Expect deliverables by the next day.
-   **Evaluation:** Monitor their progress and adaptability.
-   **Pay for Time:** Compensate them for the trial period.

Making the Offer
----------------

Crafting a competitive offer is critical:

-   **Market Rates:** Offer a salary in line with market standards and balance with shares.
-   **Perks:** Include benefits like flexible hours, remote work options, and professional development opportunities.
-   **Clarity:** Be clear about job expectations and growth opportunities.

Onboarding and Retention
------------------------

Integrate new hires smoothly:
