## Step 1: Defining the Scope of Automation

Here are the things to consider while identifying the scope of Testing Automation:

* What are the modules that can be automated?

* What are the total effective costs and the team size?

* What tests should be automated, and which approach should be taken?

## Step 2: Appropriate tool selection

It solely depends on the technology on which the application tests are built. Each tool or framework may serve different demands; therefore, a thorough understanding of multiple tool types is also a prominent factor in choosing your best tool.

For instance, some tools are better suited for web applications, while others excel at testing mobile platforms or APIs. Evaluating how well the tool integrates with your existing tech stack and supports the specific tests you need to run is essential. Thus, keeping up with the [latest automation testing tools]( https://www.functionize.com/automated-testing/automation-testing-tools-deep-dive) ensures you have the most efficient and up-to-date solutions to streamline your testing process and improve overall results.

## Step 3: Develop Test Strategy

The test strategy might be something that fewer people are focusing on in the shift to highly automated test systems and lower-level automation (which is still a strategy in itself). Still, they remain an essential aspect of articulating the testing process to all involved.

## Step 4: Evaluate the suitable framework and build your reports

Write the scripts and run the tests automatically, either by running the code directly or by calling an application’s API or user interface. Once executed, they provide detailed test reports.

## Step 5: Improve Automation testing and test cases

* Develop metrics for defining good test coverage at your company.

* Map out all your app’s features and user scenarios and rank by priority.

* Find the gaps in your current test plan.

* Use automation tools to ramp up test coverage.

* Add tests as your app gets more extensive and complex to maintain good coverage.

## Step 6: Maintain Support scripts

No matter how well you manage the automation testing, test maintenance is unavoidable if you want to expand your collection of reusable test scripts. Once your automated tests have been scripted and running, they still need updating if the application changes the next time.

## Step 7: Success Improve KPIs

KPIs are indicators, not end-states. They indicate where strong and weak points exist and should be used to call attention or as monitors against a baseline.
