## Step 1: Defining the Scope of Automation

Here are the things to consider while identifying the scope of Testing Automation:

* What are the modules that can be automated?

* What are the total effective costs and the team size?

* What are the tests to be automated, and which is the approach to be taken?

## Step 2: Appropriate tool selection

It solely depends on the technology on which the application tests are built. Each type of tool or framework may serve different demands, therefore having a thorough understanding of multiple tool types is also a prominent factor in choosing your best tool.

## Step 3: Develop Test Strategy

The test strategy might be something that fewer people are focusing on in the shift to highly automated test systems and lower-level automation (which is in itself still a strategy), but they remain an important aspect of articulating the process of testing to all involved.

## Step 4: Evaluate the suitable framework and build your reports

Write the scripts, and run the test automatically, either by running the code directly or by calling an application’s API or user interface. Once executed they provide detailed test reports.

## Step 5: Improve Automation testing and test cases

* Develop metrics for defining good test coverage at your company.

* Map out all your app’s features and user scenarios and rank by priority.

* Find the gaps in your current test plan.

* Use automation tools to ramp up test coverage.

* Add tests as your app gets bigger and more complex to maintain good coverage.

## Step 6: Maintain Support scripts

No matter how well you manage the automation testing, test maintenance is unavoidable if you want to expand your collection of reusable test scripts. Once your automated tests have been scripted and running, they still need updating if the application changes the next time.

## Step 7: Success Improve KPIs

KPIs are indicators, not end-states. They indicate where strong and weak points exist and should be used to call attention, or used as monitors against a baseline.
