When it comes to pricing strategies, simplicity is key. Over-complicating your pricing can derail your sales process. This is especially true in uncertain economic times. Let’s break down why keeping your pricing straightforward is essential for your business.

### Key Takeaways

### Recurring Revenue Vs. Usage-Based Pricing

There are two main types of pricing models: recurring revenue and usage-based pricing. Let’s look at both.

1.  **Recurring Revenue**
2.  **Usage-Based Pricing**

### Why Investors Prefer Recurring Revenue

Investors love predictable revenue. Here’s why:

*   **Stability**: Recurring revenue offers a safety net.
*   **Predictability**: It’s easier to forecast future earnings.
*   **Less Risk**: Investors worry less about sudden drops in revenue.

### The Bottom Line

In summary, keep your pricing simple. Aim for recurring revenue models. They protect your business during downturns. Plus, they make investors happy.

If you want to keep your sales process smooth, avoid complicated pricing. Remember, clarity is your friend. It helps customers make decisions and keeps your revenue steady. So, simplify your pricing and watch your sales process thrive!
