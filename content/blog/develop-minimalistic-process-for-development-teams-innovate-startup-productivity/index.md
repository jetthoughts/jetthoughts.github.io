I just finished reading ["Continuous Discovery Habits: Discover Products That Create Customer Value and Business Value."](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58046715-continuous-discovery-habits?ref=rae_0) The book combines [Impact Mapping](https://www.impactmapping.org/), Customer Interview, and [LDJ](https://go.ajsmart.com/ldj) to create a process that can be used to develop innovative products.

In 2024, I aim to create a simple process that even inexperienced startup founders can easily follow to achieve consistent results despite uncertainties.

**Here's how I imagine the approach will work:**

- Use **Impact Mapping** to prioritize business goals by aligning customer behaviors with stakeholders.
- Organize interview cycles, track insights/opportunities, and analyze prototype results with **Continuous Discovery** to understand customer needs.
- Use **LDJ** to prioritize assumptions, experiment with tests, and ideate solutions that satisfy both business and customers.
- Use **User Story Mapping**, [ShapeUp](https://basecamp.com/shapeup), and exercises from [Design Sprint](https://www.ajsmart.com/how-to-design-sprint) to create a Minimum Viable Feature (MVF) and deliver value.
- Conducting **retrospectives** to improve the process and identify what matters for the team is vital.
