2024 has been quite the year to be part of the startup ecosystem! As we wind down and get ready for the holidays and the new year, the Lightcone hosts reflect on this year’s biggest startup trends, moments, and setbacks.

### Key Takeaways

*   Startups are thriving, with many achieving significant revenue in just 24 months.
*   The myth that only large companies would benefit from AI has been debunked.
*   Open-source models have leveled the playing field for startups.
*   Voice AI and robotics are emerging as key areas for innovation.
*   The landscape of startup hiring is changing due to AI tools.

### The Startup Boom of 2024

This year has been a wild ride for startups. The landscape has shifted dramatically, allowing new companies to thrive. Many startups are now making **tens of millions of dollars** in just two years. This is a stark contrast to previous years when skepticism surrounded the potential for rapid revenue growth.

In 2023, many startups were stuck in the pilot phase, unsure if they could convert those trials into real revenue. Fast forward to 2024, and it’s clear that those pilots have turned into actual sales. The startup ecosystem is buzzing with optimism.

### The Myth of the GPT Wrapper

When ChatGPT launched, many believed that all the value would go to OpenAI. The idea was that any application built on top of ChatGPT would just be a wrapper, and startups would struggle to find their place. But guess what? That narrative has changed.

*   **OpenAI's ChatGPT Store**? A total flop.
*   **Successful startups** have emerged, creating unique applications that leverage AI without being tied to OpenAI.

Examples include companies like **Perplexity** and **Glean**, which have carved out their niches in the AI landscape. This shows that there’s plenty of room for innovation beyond the giants.

### The Rise of Open Source

Open-source models have played a crucial role in this shift. Companies like Meta have released models that allow startups to build without needing massive funding. This has opened doors for many new players in the AI space.

*   LLaMA and other models have become popular, allowing startups to create applications without relying solely on big tech.
*   The ability to run models locally has empowered developers to innovate without the constraints of high costs.

### Voice AI and Robotics: The New Frontiers

Voice AI is becoming a hot topic. It’s not just about chatbots anymore; it’s about creating **intelligent systems** that can handle complex tasks. Startups are exploring various applications, from customer support to language learning.

*   **Voice AI** is versatile and can be tailored to specific industries, making it a promising area for growth.
*   **Robotics** is also on the rise, with startups developing robots that can perform tasks in homes and businesses. The integration of AI into robotics is creating exciting possibilities.

### Changing Hiring Practices

As AI tools become more prevalent, the way startups hire is changing. Founders are now looking for engineers who are not just coders but also adept at using AI tools to enhance productivity.

*   Startups are focusing on **pair programming** and evaluating candidates based on their ability to leverage AI in coding tasks.
*   This shift means that the traditional hiring process is evolving, with a greater emphasis on adaptability and innovation.

### The Future of Startups

Looking ahead, the future seems bright for startups. The barriers to entry are lower than ever, and the potential for growth is immense. With the right tools and mindset, founders can achieve remarkable success.

*   The **in-person demo days** are back, bringing energy and excitement to the startup community.
*   San Francisco is regaining its status as a hub for innovation, with a renewed sense of optimism.

In conclusion, 2024 has proven that the startup ecosystem is alive and well. The myths surrounding AI and its impact on startups have been shattered, paving the way for a new era of innovation. As we move into the new year, the possibilities are endless!
