The dilemma is how to replace a compact yet efficient team. Your workforce consists of engineers and support staff. They have handled operations with skill up to this point. But expenses are increasing, and the outdated codebase is proving problematic. How can you navigate this shift without disrupting the established workflow?

First, familiarize yourself with [ADKAR](https://jetthoughts.com/blog/transforming-titans-outsourcing-odyssey-leadership-agile/) (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement).

ADKAR steers organizations through intricate changes. It is your guide to a smoother transformation. It shows the need for change and a desire to help. It means knowing how to change, being able to do it, and supporting its maintenance.

It is a powerful tool. This framework is not a buzzword. It will build your confidence in managing this transition.

Awareness: Be transparent
