[![What Founder Mode Really Means](file_0.webp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlonCU9txXI)

In a recent talk at a Y Combinator alumni event, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky shared insights on the concept of "founder mode". This idea has sparked discussions among late-stage founders about the challenges they face as their companies grow. Chesky's message resonated with many, emphasizing that regardless of company size, founders can still influence their organizations positively.

### Key Takeaways

*   Founder mode is about staying engaged as a leader, even in large organizations.
*   Bureaucracy can hinder effective management and decision-making.
*   Great managers understand the value of a founder's involvement.
*   Founders should actively work to cut through layers of management.
*   Learning from mistakes is crucial for growth and improvement.

### Understanding Founder Mode

Founder mode refers to the mindset and approach that founders should maintain as their companies grow. It’s easy to lose touch with the core of the business when layers of management and bureaucracy start to build up. Brian Chesky highlighted that even in large companies, founders can still make a significant impact if they remain engaged and proactive.

### The Challenge of Bureaucracy

As companies expand, they often develop complex bureaucracies. This can lead to a disconnect between the founder and the day-to-day operations. Founders may find themselves feeling like they’re operating a marionette, with little control over the strings. This separation can make it difficult to understand what’s truly happening within the company.

*   **Dunbar's Number**: This concept suggests that there’s a limit to how many relationships one can maintain. Once a company grows beyond this number, it becomes challenging for founders to stay connected with their teams.
*   **Management Layers**: The more layers of management there are, the harder it is for founders to get a clear picture of their organization. This can lead to poor decision-making and a lack of responsiveness to customer needs.

### The Importance of Great Managers

Hiring the right executives is crucial for maintaining a healthy company culture and effective operations. Great managers recognize the importance of a founder’s vision and work to incorporate it into their strategies. They don’t just manage; they collaborate with founders to achieve common goals.

*   **Finding the Right Fit**: It’s not easy to find top-tier executives, especially for startups. Many companies compete for the same talent, making it essential for founders to be strategic in their hiring processes.

### Cutting Through the Red Tape

One of the key points from Chesky’s talk was the need for founders to develop techniques to cut through the bureaucracy. This involves actively engaging with teams and understanding the challenges they face. For instance, Parker from Rippling shared his approach of involving all management levels in problem-solving discussions. This not only helps in addressing issues but also sends a message that everyone is responsible for the company’s success.

### Learning from Mistakes

Chesky emphasized the importance of acknowledging mistakes and learning from them. He shared his experiences of being sidelined in his own company due to the growing bureaucracy. Instead of blaming others, he took responsibility and encouraged other founders to do the same. This mindset fosters a culture of accountability and continuous improvement.

### Conclusion

The concept of founder mode is vital for anyone leading a growing company. It’s about staying connected, cutting through bureaucracy, and learning from experiences. As Brian Chesky pointed out, it doesn’t matter how big your company is; you can always make a change. By embracing this mindset, founders can ensure they remain at the helm of their organizations, guiding them toward success.
