When Mattermost began its journey, the concept of a traditional office was quickly deemed unnecessary. With a small team working remotely, they discovered the power of flexibility and productivity that comes with a remote-first approach. As the company expanded, they learned valuable lessons that can help others thrive in a remote work environment.

### Key Takeaways

*   Embrace pair design for effective collaboration.
*   Prioritize documentation for onboarding and culture.
*   Seek candidates with strong writing skills for remote roles.

### The Power of Pair Design in Remote Collaboration

One of the standout advantages of remote work is the ability to collaborate asynchronously. However, this can complicate large group projects. Mattermost found that breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable parts allows for more effective collaboration. By implementing pair design practices, two team members can tackle a problem together, refining their ideas before presenting them to the larger group. This method not only enhances productivity but also leads to more polished solutions.

### The Importance of Documentation for Onboarding and Culture

A common misconception is that strong company culture can only be built in person. Mattermost challenges this notion by emphasizing the importance of documentation. A well-structured onboarding process, supported by comprehensive documentation, ensures that all new hires have access to the same foundational knowledge. This approach allows for a more scalable and efficient onboarding experience, enabling new employees to engage in meaningful conversations from day one.

### Finding the Right Fit: Writing Skills Matter

As remote work becomes more prevalent, itâ€™s crucial to identify candidates who thrive in this environment. Mattermost has found that strong writing skills are a key indicator of success in remote roles. Individuals who excel at written communication are often better equipped to navigate the challenges of remote work, as they can effectively consume and convey information without relying on face-to-face interactions.

### Conclusion

Mattermost's journey highlights the evolving landscape of remote work and the strategies that can lead to success. By embracing pair design, prioritizing documentation, and focusing on candidates with strong writing skills, companies can create a thriving remote work culture. As the world continues to adapt to new work environments, these lessons serve as a valuable guide for organizations looking to enhance their remote productivity.
