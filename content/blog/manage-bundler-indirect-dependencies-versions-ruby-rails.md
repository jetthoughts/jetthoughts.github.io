## Manage Bundler indirect dependencies versions

Have you seen that bundler stuck on finding how to upgrade your gems? What to do if there is a new breaking version of the *indirect* dependency, causing deployment fails?

Sometimes we got broken deploy, because of the not supported version of the *gem*, and it has been used automatically as an *indirect* dependency.

Or bundler could find any upgrade because of conflict of the indirect dependencies.

So what can we do? How could we help bundler find better versions for indirect dependencies?

## Migrate from *indirect* to direct dependency status

Yep, thatâ€™s all. We just need to add *indirect* dependency as *direct*. And do not forget to add a notice comment to make sure that this gem is required only for assigning version constraints.

With explicit version constraints assigned for *indirect* (and now *direct*) dependency, the bundler will have to satisfy them and will change other gems.
