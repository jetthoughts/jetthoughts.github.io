In a world buzzing with talk about artificial intelligence, many are left wondering why it hasn't yet transformed our daily lives as expected. Dalton and Michael dive into the current state of AI, exploring its real-world applications and the hype surrounding it.

### Key Takeaways

*   AI is making strides in customer service, but it’s not as visible to everyday users.
*   Developers are experiencing significant productivity boosts with AI tools like GitHub Copilot.
*   The impact of AI is profound, even if it’s not immediately obvious.
*   Historical context shows that major tech revolutions take time to unfold.

### The Hype Cycle of AI

The conversation around AI often swings between two extremes: it’s either overhyped or underhyped. The reality is that while some demos look impressive, the actual products can fall short. For instance, when you think about how often you use AI in your daily life, it might not be as frequent as you’d expect. Unlike the seamless integration of Google Search into our routines, AI hasn’t yet reached that level of ubiquity.

### Customer Service: A Major Use Case

One of the first areas where AI is making a noticeable impact is in customer service. We’ve all had frustrating experiences with customer support, whether it’s Xfinity, Verizon, or United Airlines. These interactions are notoriously bad, and AI is stepping in to improve them. While you might not notice these changes immediately, they are happening behind the scenes.

*   Why AI in Customer Service?
  *   It addresses a significant pain point in customer interactions.
  *   It’s competing against a system that is already failing.
  *   Many companies are hesitant to promote their AI solutions due to job concerns and potential backlash from bad press.

### Developers and AI Tools

For developers, the experience with AI is quite different. Tools like GitHub Copilot are changing the game, making coding more efficient. The adoption rates are high among programmers, and the productivity gains are substantial. This is a clear example of how AI can enhance specific industries, even if it doesn’t make headlines.

### Internet Research and Everyday Use

AI is also reshaping how we conduct internet research. For instance, children today can ask questions and receive instant answers, making learning more interactive. This capability might not seem groundbreaking, but it’s a significant shift in how information is accessed and processed.

### The Gig Economy and AI

When we think about the impact of technology, it’s essential to consider the gig economy. Services like Uber and DoorDash have changed how we interact with the world. AI hasn’t yet created a similar revolution, but it’s worth noting that the gig economy took time to develop and normalize.

### Historical Context Matters

Reflecting on the past, it’s easy to romanticize the arrival of smartphones and other technologies. However, the truth is that these innovations didn’t change everything overnight. The same applies to AI. We might not see immediate, flashy results, but the groundwork is being laid for significant changes in the future.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while AI might not be blowing our minds just yet, it’s quietly making a difference in various sectors. The real impact may be subtle and behind the scenes, but it’s there. As we continue to explore and fund new AI innovations, we can expect to see more exciting developments in the years to come. The journey of AI is just beginning, and it’s worth keeping an eye on what’s next.
