about_us_block1:
  headline: Our Mission
  items:
    - In the software development world, two world-class developers can outperform an army of sub-par engineers.
    - At JetThoughts, we believe in the power of curating technical talent and strive to differentiate ourselves on the quality of our work.
    - To ensure we deliver the best outcomes every time, we choose to work with only a few clients at a time and make them our primary focus.
    - By giving each client more attention in the spotlight, we&#8217;re able to improve alignment, make more progress, and create better long-term relationships.


about_us_block2:
  headline: Our Culture
  items:
    - Culture is essential for a software development team, because a single motivated & high-energy developer can outperform a team that&#8217;s overwhelmed or lazy.
    - To create a truly legendary team, we believe it&#8217;s important to hire carefully and spend the time to develop a culture that can achieve quality consistently.
    - At JetThoughts, we don&#8217;t typically fire our employees because we hire strategically with intent to secure the right long-term partners for our team.
    - As a tight-knit group of heavily-vetted developers, we are able to focus harder, understand deeper, and stay more adaptable than larger development firms.
