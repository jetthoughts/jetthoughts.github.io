    - At JetThoughts, we don&#8217;t typically fire our employees because we hire strategically with intent to secure the right long-term partners for our team.
    - As a tight-knit group of heavily-vetted developers, we are able to focus harder, understand deeper, and stay more adaptable than larger development firms.
