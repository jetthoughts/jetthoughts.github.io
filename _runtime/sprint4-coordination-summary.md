## 🔄 Sprint 4 TDD Cycle Workflow

### Phase 1: RED - Test-First Development
**Pair**: Test-Writer-Driver + Test-Writer-Navigator
**Objective**: Write failing behavior-focused visual regression tests

**Activities**:
1. Create failing Minitest screenshot tests for c-card variations
2. Create failing tests for c-grid systems (2-col, 3-col, 4-col)
3. Create failing tests for c-form elements (input states, validation UI)
4. Validate: Tests fail with meaningful error messages
5. Store RED phase completion: `tdd/red-phase/sprint4-[component]-[timestamp]`

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Tests validate BEHAVIOR (visual output), not implementation (CSS structure)
- [ ] Tests follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- [ ] Zero implementation/existence/configuration tests
- [ ] Interface design is clean and purposeful

**Memory Coordination**:
```yaml
tdd/red-phase/sprint4-cards-20250930: "Failing tests for c-card variations"
tdd/red-phase/sprint4-grids-20250930: "Failing tests for c-grid systems"
tdd/red-phase/sprint4-forms-20250930: "Failing tests for c-form elements"
```

---

### Phase 2: GREEN - Shameless Green Implementation
**Pair**: Implementer-Driver + Architecture-Expert (navigator)
**Objective**: Implement embarrassingly simple code to pass tests

**Strategy Selection**:
- **c-card**: Fake It (Medium complexity) - Accept hardcoded constants
- **c-grid**: Triangulation (High complexity) - Multiple examples force generalization
- **c-form**: Hybrid (Fake It base + Triangulation states)

**Activities**:
1. Implement c-card variations with hardcoded dual-class selectors (Fake It)
2. Implement c-grid variations as separate examples (2-col, 3-col, 4-col - Triangulation)
3. Implement c-form base fields (Fake It) + state examples (Triangulation)
4. Run `bin/rake test:critical` after EACH micro-change
5. Store GREEN phase completion: `tdd/green-phase/sprint4-[component]-[timestamp]`

**Shameless Green Acceptance**:
- ✅ Accept hardcoded implementations
- ✅ Accept duplication across components
- ✅ Accept boring, obvious solutions
- ❌ NO consolidation during GREEN phase
- ❌ NO DRY principles yet

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] All tests pass (including new tests from RED phase)
- [ ] Implementation is minimal and focused
- [ ] No over-engineering or premature optimization
- [ ] Visual regressions ≤3% tolerance
- [ ] `bin/rake test:critical` passes after each micro-change

**Memory Coordination**:
```yaml
tdd/green-phase/sprint4-cards-20250930: "Shameless green c-card variations (Fake It)"
tdd/green-phase/sprint4-grids-20250930: "Shameless green c-grid systems (Triangulation)"
tdd/green-phase/sprint4-forms-20250930: "Shameless green c-form elements (Hybrid)"
tdd/strategy/sprint4-cards/fake_it: "Strategy: Fake It (Medium complexity)"
tdd/strategy/sprint4-grids/triangulation: "Strategy: Triangulation (High complexity)"
tdd/strategy/sprint4-forms/hybrid: "Strategy: Fake It + Triangulation hybrid"
```

---

### Phase 3: REFACTOR - Flocking Rules Application
**Pair**: Refactor-Driver + Refactor-Navigator
**Objective**: Apply flocking rules systematically to eliminate duplication

**Flocking Rules Process** (3 steps per micro-commit):
1. **Select things most alike** - Identify duplication patterns
2. **Find smallest difference** - Analyze pattern variations
3. **Make simplest change** - Eliminate differences minimally

**Activities**:
1. Apply flocking rules to c-card duplication (padding, border-radius, box-shadow)
2. Apply flocking rules to c-grid duplication (grid-template-columns, gap, responsive)
3. Apply flocking rules to c-form duplication (border-color, box-shadow states)
4. Commit after EACH flocking rule micro-step
5. Run `bin/rake test:critical` after EACH micro-step
6. Store REFACTOR completion: `tdd/refactor-phase/sprint4-[component]-[timestamp]`

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] All tests remain green after each flocking rule micro-step
- [ ] Duplication eliminated systematically
- [ ] Code design improved without changing behavior
- [ ] No new functionality added during refactor
- [ ] Micro-commits: ≥15 commits across Sprint 4
- [ ] Visual regressions ≤3% tolerance maintained

**Memory Coordination**:
```yaml
tdd/refactor-phase/sprint4-cards-20250930: "Flocking rules applied to c-card duplication"
tdd/refactor-phase/sprint4-grids-20250930: "Flocking rules applied to c-grid duplication"
tdd/refactor-phase/sprint4-forms-20250930: "Flocking rules applied to c-form duplication"
shameless_green/flocking_steps/sprint4-cards-session1: "Card padding consolidation"
shameless_green/flocking_steps/sprint4-grids-session1: "Grid column parameterization"
shameless_green/flocking_steps/sprint4-forms-session1: "Form state color extraction"
```

### Phase 4: VALIDATION - Quality Gates & Coverage
**Analysts**: Coverage-Analyst + Test-Quality-Expert
**Objective**: Validate Sprint 4 completion meets TDD quality standards

**Coverage Analyst Activities**:
1. Validate >95% CSS coverage target across extracted components
2. Validate FIRST principles compliance (Fast, Isolated, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely)
3. Generate coverage metrics: `tdd/coverage/sprint4/[component]/[timestamp]`
4. Verify visual regression tolerance ≤3% across all critical paths

**Test Quality Expert Activities**:
1. Validate behavioral focus (NO implementation/existence/configuration tests)
2. Detect and reject test smells using anti-test-smell framework
3. Ensure zero test smell violations across Sprint 4 test suite
4. Validate test stability during REFACTOR phase

**Quality Gate Checklist** (MANDATORY):
- [ ] All tests pass: `bin/rake test:critical` (100% pass rate)
- [ ] Visual regressions ≤3% tolerance maintained
- [ ] >95% CSS coverage achieved for extracted components
- [ ] Zero test smells detected (behavioral focus validated)
- [ ] FIRST principles compliance verified
- [ ] Micro-commits: ≥15 commits across RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- [ ] Documentation updated: Sprint 4 outcomes recorded in `_runtime/`

**Memory Coordination**:
```yaml
tdd/coverage/sprint4/c-card/coverage-20250930: ">95% coverage achieved"
tdd/coverage/sprint4/c-grid/coverage-20250930: ">95% coverage achieved"
tdd/coverage/sprint4/c-form/coverage-20250930: ">95% coverage achieved"
tdd/quality-gates/sprint4-red/validation: "RED phase quality gates passed"
tdd/quality-gates/sprint4-green/validation: "GREEN phase quality gates passed"
tdd/quality-gates/sprint4-refactor/validation: "REFACTOR phase quality gates passed"
```

## 🚨 Sprint 4 Risk Mitigation (Zero Tolerance)

### Risk 1: FL-Builder Dual-Class Compatibility (HIGH)
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain dual-class selectors throughout GREEN phase
- Test FL-Builder integration after EACH micro-change
- Use visual regression tests to detect FL-Builder breakage
- Rollback immediately if FL-Builder functionality degrades

**XP Coach Enforcement**: WIP=1 ensures focused attention on each component

### Risk 2: Grid System Complexity (HIGH)
**Mitigation**:
- Use Triangulation strategy to force systematic generalization
- Implement grid variations as separate examples in GREEN phase
- Apply flocking rules methodically during REFACTOR phase
- Validate responsive behavior at 768px, 968px breakpoints

**TDD Coordinator Enforcement**: Phase transition gates prevent premature consolidation

### Risk 3: Visual Regression Tolerance Exceeded (MEDIUM)
**Mitigation**:
- Run `bin/rake test:critical` after EACH micro-change
- Use 3% visual regression tolerance as hard limit
- Rollback immediately if tolerance exceeded
- Update visual baselines ONLY if intentional design change

**Test Quality Expert Enforcement**: Behavioral focus prevents fragile tests

### Risk 4: Test Smell Introduction (MEDIUM)
**Mitigation**:
- Zero tolerance test smell detection active (Test-Quality-Expert)
- Reject implementation/existence/configuration tests immediately
- Validate behavioral focus during RED phase
- Four-Eyes principle: Navigator reviews all test creation

**Architecture Expert Enforcement**: System design patterns prevent architectural smells
