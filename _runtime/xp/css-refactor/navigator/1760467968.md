# CSS Refactor Navigator - Session Start

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-14 20:30:00
**Current State**: WP1.1 extraction progress (2/22 completed)
**Last Commit**: 36418264b - `.fl-row, .fl-row-content` margin utilities extracted from 590-layout.css

## Phase 1 WP1.1 Status

**Goal**: Extract all `.fl-row` patterns from 590-layout.css to fl-foundation.css
**Progress**: 2/22 extractions completed
**Method**: Micro-commit discipline (≤3 lines per change)

### Completed Extractions
1. ✅ `.fl-row-content-wrap { position: relative; }` - moved to critical/fl-layout-grid.css
2. ✅ `.fl-row, .fl-row-content` margin utilities - moved to fl-foundation.css

### Navigation Strategy for Remaining 20 Extractions

**Pattern Identification Protocol**:
- Search 590-layout.css for remaining `.fl-row` patterns
- Validate pattern is NOT page-specific (no `.fl-node-{hash}`)
- Validate pattern is NOT layout-critical (Foundation dependency check)
- Extract ENTIRE rule set (no partial extractions)

**Red Flags to Monitor**:
- Driver extracting `.fl-node-{hash}` selectors → STOP immediately
- Driver skipping test execution → STOP, enforce bin/rake test:critical
- Driver consolidating patterns before extraction → STOP, extract first
- Test failures ignored → STOP, rollback and investigate

**Coordination Points**:
- Validate Driver's next pattern selection before extraction
- Ensure tests run after EACH extraction
- Verify commit message accuracy (WP1.1 X/22 format)
- Escalate blockers to Queen Coordinator

## Next Actions for Driver

Driver should continue with **item 3/22**:
- Identify next `.fl-row` pattern in 590-layout.css
- Validate it's extractable (not page-specific, not layout-critical)
- Extract to fl-foundation.css
- Test with bin/rake test:critical
- Commit if GREEN

**Navigator Role**: Monitor Driver's pattern selection and provide real-time feedback.
