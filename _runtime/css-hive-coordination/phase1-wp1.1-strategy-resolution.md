# Phase 1 WP1.1 Strategy Resolution
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-14
**Decision Authority**: Queen Coordinator (CSS Hive Mind Swarm)

## ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Micro-Commit Per Pattern Approach

**Coder Agent Question**: 590-layout.css has 10+ .fl-row patterns - commit per pattern or per file?

**Answer**: **Commit per pattern** (‚â§3 lines per commit)

## üéØ Rationale

### XP Compliance
- CLAUDE.md mandate: "Micro-commits: 5-20/hour target"
- XP Coach mandate: "Commit after EACH micro-step"
- Flocking rules: "Commit after each flocking rule micro-step"

### Safety & Rollback
- **Independent testability**: Each pattern extraction is self-contained
- **Granular rollback**: Can revert single pattern failure without losing others
- **Test discipline**: `bin/rake test:critical` after EACH extraction ensures continuous validation
- **Risk mitigation**: If pattern breaks tests, only lose 1 pattern's work (‚â§3 lines)

### Progress Tracking
- **Transparency**: Each commit shows clear progress toward 2,129 .fl-row target
- **Velocity measurement**: Can track patterns/hour extraction rate
- **Audit trail**: Clear history of which patterns extracted when

## üìã Micro-Commit Protocol (Coder Agent Directive)

### Workflow (Repeat Until File Complete)
```bash
# Step 1: Extract single .fl-row pattern
# - Identify most duplicated .fl-row variant in current file
# - Copy pattern to themes/beaver/assets/css/foundation/_fl-builder-layouts.css
# - Remove pattern from current file (‚â§3 lines changed)

# Step 2: Test immediately
bin/rake test:critical

# Step 3: Commit or rollback
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
  git add -A
  git commit -m "refactor(css): extract .fl-row [variant] to foundation (WP1.1)"
  echo "‚úÖ Pattern extracted, tests pass, committed"
else
  git restore .
  echo "‚ùå Tests failed, rolled back, investigate"
fi

# Step 4: Coordinate with Tester
# Notify: "Commit [hash] ready for validation - extracted .fl-row [variant]"

# Step 5: Repeat for next pattern
```

### Current Task: 590-layout.css
- **Status**: 2 commits made, 10+ .fl-row patterns remaining
- **Expected commits**: 10-15 micro-commits for this single file
- **Priority**: Most frequently duplicated .fl-row variants first
- **Block list**: Respected - NOT touching 3086-layout2.css or page-specific overrides

### Target File
- **Foundation extraction target**: `themes/beaver/assets/css/foundation/_fl-builder-layouts.css`
- **Pattern organization**: Group by selector (.fl-row, .fl-col, .fl-module, .fl-visible)
- **Comments**: Add pattern variant comments for maintainability

### Commit Message Format
```
refactor(css): extract .fl-row [variant] to foundation (WP1.1)

- Extracted .fl-row.[variant] pattern from [source-file].css
- Target: themes/beaver/assets/css/foundation/_fl-builder-layouts.css
- Tests: bin/rake test:critical passed
- Visual: No layout changes (refactoring only)
```

## üìä Documentation Reconciliation

**Original estimate**: "32 commits for WP1.1" (1 commit per file √ó 32 layout files)

**Actual with micro-commit discipline**: 200-300+ commits (10+ patterns per file √ó 32 files)

**Conclusion**: Documentation was MINIMUM estimate. Actual micro-commit approach EXCEEDS documentation target ‚Üí better safety, better XP compliance, better rollback granularity.

## üîÑ Coordination Protocol

### Coder ‚Üí Tester ‚Üí Reviewer Loop
1. **Coder**: Extracts pattern, tests, commits
2. **Coder notification**: "Commit [hash] ready - extracted .fl-row [variant] from [file]"
3. **Tester**: Validates commit with `bin/rake test:critical` + visual regression check
4. **Tester notification**: "Commit [hash] validated ‚úÖ" or "Commit [hash] BLOCKED ‚ùå - [issue]"
5. **Reviewer**: Code review for pattern accuracy, foundation placement, commit message
6. **Reviewer notification**: "Commit [hash] approved ‚úÖ" or "Commit [hash] needs revision - [feedback]"
7. **Loop**: Coder continues to next pattern

### Progress Tracking
- **Patterns extracted**: Count increments with each commit
- **Lines eliminated**: Track cumulative reduction toward 600-900 WP1.1 target
- **Files completed**: Mark files done when all .fl-row patterns extracted
- **Work packages**: WP1.1 complete when all 32 layout files processed

## üöÄ Immediate Action

**Coder Agent**: Resume 590-layout.css extraction using micro-commit protocol above. Extract next .fl-row pattern, test, commit. Notify Tester after each commit. Continue until file complete.

**Tester Agent**: Monitor for Coder commit notifications. Validate each commit immediately. Report pass/fail to coordination channel.

**Reviewer Agent**: Monitor for Tester validation completion. Review pattern accuracy and commit quality. Approve or request revisions.

**Queen Coordinator**: Track progress toward 2,129 .fl-row target. Orchestrate WP1.2-1.4 after WP1.1 completion.
