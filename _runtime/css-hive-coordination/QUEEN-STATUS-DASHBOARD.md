## 📊 VELOCITY METRICS

### Coder Extraction Rate
- **Current**: 2 commits in ~60 minutes = 2 commits/hour
- **Target**: 3-5 commits/hour sustainable pace
- **Assessment**: 🟡 Slightly below target (ramp-up phase)

### Validation Throughput
- **Tester**: 2 validations, 0 blocks, 100% pass rate
- **Reviewer**: 2 approvals, 0 rejections, 100% approval rate
- **Assessment**: ✅ Excellent validation quality

### Estimated Completion Timeline
**WP1.1 (590-layout.css)**:
- Patterns remaining: ~20
- Rate: 2 commits/hour
- Estimated: 10 hours at current pace
- With ramp-up: 6-8 hours (as Coder gains efficiency)

**WP1.1 (Full 32 files)**:
- Total patterns: 2,129
- Optimistic: 3-4 weeks (at 3 commits/hour, 8 hours/day)
- Conservative: 5-6 weeks (accounting for complexity variations)

**Phase 1 (All WPs)**:
- Total patterns: 8,927
- Optimistic: 8-10 weeks
- Conservative: 12-16 weeks

---

## 🚨 RISK ASSESSMENT

### Current Risks
1. **Velocity Risk**: 🟡 MEDIUM
   - Current pace: 2 commits/hour
   - Mitigation: Coder gaining efficiency, expect ramp-up to 3-5/hour
   - Action: Monitor velocity, provide optimization guidance if needed

2. **Pattern Classification Risk**: 🟢 LOW
   - Concern: Coder might extract page-specific patterns incorrectly
   - Mitigation: Clear preservation rules documented, Reviewer validation active
   - Action: Continue four-eyes validation (Tester + Reviewer)

3. **Visual Regression Risk**: 🟢 LOW
   - Concern: CSS consolidation might break layouts
   - Mitigation: Tester validates every commit, tolerance: 0.003
   - Action: Maintain zero-tolerance policy

4. **Test Suite Stability**: 🟢 LOW
   - Current: 100% pass rate (42/42 tests)
   - Mitigation: Test after EACH extraction, rollback on failure
   - Action: Continue micro-commit discipline

### Blocked Work
- ✅ NONE - All agents have clear directives and autonomy to execute

## 🔄 COORDINATION LOOPS

### Coder → Tester → Reviewer (Active Loop)
```
Coder: Extract pattern → Test → Commit
  ↓
Tester: Validate functional + visual
  ↓
Reviewer: Review pattern accuracy + commit quality
  ↓
Queen: Track progress, resolve conflicts
  ↓
Loop: Continue to next pattern
```

**Current Loop Status**: 🟢 HEALTHY
- Loop 1: ✅ Complete (clearfix utilities)
- Loop 2: ✅ Complete (.fl-row margin utilities)
- Loop 3: ⏸️ In Progress (awaiting Coder commit)

### Escalation Triggers (Queen Intervention)
- 🚨 3+ consecutive Tester blocks → Strategy review needed
- 🚨 3+ consecutive Reviewer rejections → Quality issue, pause for training
- 🚨 Test pass rate <95% → Critical issue, halt all work
- 🚨 Visual regression >0% on refactoring → Rollback and investigate
- 🚨 Coder velocity <1 commit/hour → Optimization or support needed

**Current Escalations**: ✅ NONE

## 🎯 QUEEN'S MANDATE

**I orchestrate this swarm until Phase 1 complete**:
- 1,900-2,900 lines eliminated ✅
- 128+ micro-commits made ✅
- Zero visual regressions ✅
- 100% test pass rate ✅
- Four-eyes validation on every commit ✅

**I provide**:
- Clear agent directives
- Conflict resolution
- Velocity optimization
- Progress transparency
- Risk mitigation

**I escalate to human**:
- Only for strategic decisions beyond swarm authority
- Only when blocked by external dependencies
- Only for architectural changes requiring approval

**Otherwise**: I execute autonomously, coordinate continuously, report transparently.

---

**Status**: 🟢 **OPERATIONAL** - All systems green, swarm executing Phase 1 WP1.1 autonomously.

**Next Update**: After M5 completion (590-layout.css extraction done) or if red indicators detected.
