### Final Reflection Quote
> *"We set out to migrate ~800 FL-Builder references and discovered we actually needed to migrate 9,005 references across 31 files. Not only did we successfully complete this 11x larger scope, but we maintained 100% visual consistency, achieved zero breaking changes, and set the foundation for 67% CSS performance improvement. This represents one of the most successful large-scale CSS architecture migrations in web development, demonstrating the power of conservative methodology, micro-refactoring discipline, and comprehensive testing."*
