## FAQ Schema Markup Integration

```yaml
faqs:
  - question: "What is a fractional CTO and how does it differ from a full-time CTO?"
    answer: "A fractional CTO is an experienced technology executive who provides strategic technical leadership on a part-time or contract basis. Unlike a full-time CTO, a fractional CTO offers the same high-level expertise and strategic guidance but at a fraction of the cost, typically working 10-20 hours per week. This model is perfect for startups and growing companies that need executive-level technical leadership but can't justify the $200,000+ salary of a full-time CTO."
  - question: "How much do fractional CTO services cost compared to hiring a full-time CTO?"
    answer: "Fractional CTO services typically cost between $5,000-$15,000 per month, depending on the scope and time commitment required. This represents 60-80% cost savings compared to a full-time CTO salary, which averages $250,000-$400,000 annually plus benefits and equity. With JetThoughts, you get 18+ years of industry experience and proven results at a predictable monthly cost."
    
  - question: "What specific services does a fractional CTO provide?"
    answer: "A fractional CTO provides comprehensive technical leadership including: technology strategy and roadmap development, software architecture decisions, development team hiring and management, technical due diligence for investors, security and compliance oversight, vendor evaluation and management, and bridging communication between technical teams and business stakeholders. We tailor our services to your specific business needs and growth stage."
    
  - question: "What industries and company sizes benefit most from fractional CTO services?"
    answer: "Fractional CTO services are ideal for: early-stage startups (pre-Series A) needing technical validation, growing companies (10-100 employees) scaling their development teams, non-technical founders building software products, companies undergoing digital transformation, and businesses preparing for technical due diligence. We've successfully worked with companies in fintech, healthcare, e-commerce, SaaS, and professional services industries."
    
  - question: "How do you ensure knowledge transfer and continuity with fractional engagement?"
    answer: "We maintain continuity through comprehensive documentation of all technical decisions, architectural diagrams, and strategic recommendations. Our fractional CTOs work closely with your internal team to transfer knowledge and establish sustainable processes. We use collaborative tools like Slack, GitHub, and project management platforms to maintain consistent communication. Many of our fractional CTO relationships evolve into long-term partnerships, with our average client relationship lasting 5+ years."
    
  - question: "What's the typical engagement duration and how quickly can you start?"
    answer: "Most fractional CTO engagements range from 6 months to 2+ years, depending on your company's growth stage and needs. We can typically start within 1-2 weeks after initial consultation and agreement. The engagement can be scaled up or down based on your evolving needs - from 10 hours per week during planning phases to 30+ hours during critical development periods or funding rounds."
    
  - question: "How do you measure success in a fractional CTO engagement?"
    answer: "We establish clear success metrics at the beginning of each engagement, typically including: reduced development cycle times, improved code quality and technical debt metrics, successful team scaling and reduced turnover, on-time project delivery, improved technical documentation and processes, and positive feedback from development teams. We provide monthly reports showing progress against these KPIs and adjust our approach based on results."
    
  - question: "Can a fractional CTO help with fundraising and investor relations?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Our fractional CTOs have extensive experience supporting fundraising efforts by: preparing technical due diligence materials, creating compelling technology presentations for investors, developing realistic technical roadmaps and timelines, conducting security and compliance audits, and representing the technical vision during investor meetings. We've helped clients successfully raise over $50M in funding by providing credible technical leadership during the fundraising process."
    
  - question: "What makes JetThoughts different from other fractional CTO providers?"
    answer: "JetThoughts combines 18 years of industry experience with a proven track record of long-term client relationships (5-year average). Our fractional CTOs are hands-on technical leaders who have built and scaled development teams, not just consultants. We offer comprehensive services from strategic planning to hands-on implementation, and our developers have an average of 8+ years of experience. We also provide flexible engagement models that can adapt as your company grows."
    
  - question: "Do you work with companies that already have technical teams?"
    answer: "Yes, we frequently work with companies that have existing development teams. Our fractional CTOs excel at: evaluating and optimizing current technical processes, mentoring existing technical leads, implementing best practices and improving code quality, facilitating better communication between technical and business teams, and providing strategic direction for complex technical decisions. We integrate seamlessly with your existing team to enhance their capabilities rather than replace them."

## Schema Markup Implementation

The FAQ schema is automatically generated from the `faqs` frontmatter data. The partial template `/themes/beaver/layouts/partials/seo/faq-schema.html` expects this structure:

```yaml
faqs:
  - question: "Your question here?"
    answer: "Your detailed answer here..."
  - question: "Another question?"
    answer: "Another detailed answer..."
```

**Note**: The FAQ schema partial automatically processes `.Params.faqs` data - no additional schema markup configuration is needed in frontmatter.
