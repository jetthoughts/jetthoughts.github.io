## 📅 PHASE 1: Critical CSS Inline Consolidation

**Phase Status**: 🔲 Not Started

**Target Impact**: 300-400 lines eliminated (30% reduction from inline CSS)
**Risk Level**: LOW - Utilities creation, no complex refactoring

### Work Package Status

#### WP1.1: CSS Variables Foundation 🔄 IN PROGRESS
```yaml
status: 🔄 In Progress (font-system-ui extraction COMPLETE 2026-07-11)
priority: P0 🔥 Critical
duration: 4-6 hours
files_affected: 12 inline critical CSS files
impact: 2.8KB savings, ~50 lines eliminated
micro_commits_target: 15-20 commits

tasks:
  - [x] Create foundations/css-variables.css with design tokens (pre-existing, 2025-10-12)
  - [x] Extract --font-system-ui variable — ALL exact-match literal stacks
        (25 stacks across 8 critical files) replaced with var(--font-system-ui);
        @import wired into the 3 no-base bundles (careers, single-careers,
        single-use-cases) that never defined the variable
  - [ ] Extract --color-primary, --color-secondary, --color-text
  - [ ] Extract --border-radius-default, --spacing-unit
  - [x] Dedup the identical 35-line Bootstrap :root block copied across
        8 critical files — DELETED outright (sprint 2, 2026-07-11): zero
        var() consumers repo-wide, so no relocation needed; 280 lines
        removed; vendor base-4.min.css copy untouched
  - [x] Validation: bin/rake test:critical (46/46 pass, 84 screenshots 0 diffs)
  - [x] Validation: bin/dtest Linux gate (46/46 pass, per commit)
  - [ ] Validation: FCP metrics unchanged

blockers: NONE
dependencies: NONE (can start immediately)
assigned_to: Claude (sprint 1, 2026-07-11)
started_date: 2026-07-11
completed_date: -
actual_duration: ~2.5 hours (sprint 1)
actual_commits: 10 (c2a161f6..498edbba), 9 files, +44/-420 lines
notes: |
  Foundation for all CSS variable usage.
  Sprint-1 findings:
  - careers bundle had 4 var(--font-system-ui) usages with NO definition
    (unresolved var since a prior partial extraction) — fixed by @import.
  - use-cases-critical.css is ORPHANED (no template loads it; repo-wide
    grep finds zero loaders). Follow-up: wire into use-cases bundle or delete.
  - Variant stacks (short system-ui + Bootstrap-reboot -apple-system-first)
    intentionally NOT converted — different values, would be value changes.
