## üéØ COPY-PASTE EXECUTION PROMPT

```markdown
Execute the complete CSS migration goal (docs/projects/2509-css-migration/) with full autonomous swarm coordination. Deploy specialized XP team following strict handbook compliance and internal approval delegation.

**GOAL**: Eliminate 70-80% CSS duplication (27,094-31,536 lines) across jt_site through 3-phase execution with zero human stops.

**AUTHORITY CHAIN**:
- **Goal Definition**: 35-39-project-management/35.04-revised-goal-css-duplication-elimination.md (SUPREME AUTHORITY)
- **Project Navigation**: PROJECT-INDEX.md (Central hub)
- **Task Tracking**: TASK-TRACKER.md (Real-time status)
- **Global Standards**: /knowledge/ handbooks (TDD, Four-Eyes, Shameless Green, Anti-Test-Smell)
- **Project Standards**: ANALYST-CONTEXT.md (jt_site adaptations)

**EXECUTION MODE**: Continuous autonomous with internal swarm approvals
