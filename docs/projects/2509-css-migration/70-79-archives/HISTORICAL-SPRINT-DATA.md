## Goal Revision (2025-10-12)

**Revised Scope**: CSS duplication elimination ONLY
- **IN SCOPE**: Pattern extraction into 5-7 foundation files (70-80% duplication reduction)
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: FL-node HTML migration (572 refs), CSS rules migration (8,449 rules), BEM component implementation

**Deferred Work**:
- Phase 2: HTML FL-node migration (572 references) → Separate initiative
- Phase 3: CSS rules consolidation (8,449 rules) → Out of scope
- Phase 4: CSS file analysis (91 files) → Out of scope
- FL-Builder migration (8,406 occurrences) → Separate initiative

**Reason for Revision**: Focus on achievable CSS optimization (80-110h) vs bloated multi-phase migration (120-170h)
