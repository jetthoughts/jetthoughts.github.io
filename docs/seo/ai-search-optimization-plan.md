   - Missing founder credentials and expertise positioning
   - No "founded by" or individual expert profiles

   - AI search prefers structured problem-solving narratives
   - Missing quantified results (time saved, cost reduced, etc.)
   - No clear before/after comparisons

4. **Service Pages Could Be More Conversational**:
   - AI search favors natural language answers
   - Limited question-based content structure
   - Could strengthen outcome focus

5. **Citation-Ready Content Gap**:
   - Missing "according to JetThoughts" quotable expertise
   - Limited industry insights AI can reference
