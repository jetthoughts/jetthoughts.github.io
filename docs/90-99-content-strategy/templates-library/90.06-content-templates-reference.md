7 techniques that reduced our response times by 60%:

1/8 
```

#### Template 2: Industry Commentary
```markdown
Hot take: Most "fractional CTO" arrangements fail because they're actually just senior dev contractors.

Real fractional CTOs:
→ Build technical strategy
→ Scale teams and processes  
→ Make architecture decisions
→ Connect tech to business goals

Contractors:
→ Write code
→ Fix immediate problems
→ Follow existing patterns

The value is in the strategy, not just the execution.
```

#### Template 3: Quick Tips
```markdown
Rails performance tip:

Instead of:
```ruby
users.each do |user|
  puts user.posts.count
end
```

Do:
```ruby
users.includes(:posts).each do |user|
  puts user.posts.size
end
```

Reduces N+1 queries → 10x faster execution
