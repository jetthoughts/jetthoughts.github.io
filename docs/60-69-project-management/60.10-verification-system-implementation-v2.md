# 60.10 Verification System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive verification system implemented for JT Site to prevent broken changes and enforce handbook compliance.

## System Components

### 1. Pre-Commit Validation (`/.claude/hooks/pre-commit-validation.sh`)

**Purpose**: Enforce quality gates before any code can be committed

**Validations Performed**:
- Four-Eyes Principle compliance check
- TDD methodology verification
- Zero-defect philosophy enforcement
- Hugo build validation with `bun run test:build` for comprehensive diagnostics
- Content quality checks
- Performance regression detection
- Agent pairing verification

**Build:Debug Integration Benefits**:
- **Production Rendering Verification**: Ensures production-ready output without deployment
- **Template Performance Analysis**: Identifies template optimization opportunities
- **Memory Usage Tracking**: Detects potential memory bottlenecks before deployment
- **Cache Issue Detection**: Bypasses cache to find cache-related problems early
- **Path Warning Detection**: Identifies unused templates and path issues for cleanup

**Failure Actions**:
- Block commit on critical errors
- Warn on non-critical issues
- Create rollback checkpoint on success

### 2. Rollback Mechanism (`/.claude/hooks/rollback-mechanism.sh`)

**Purpose**: Provide atomic rollback capability for failed changes

**Features**:
- Automatic rollback on critical failures
- Manual rollback with checkpoint selection
- Emergency rollback for system failures
- Checkpoint management (maintains last 10)
- Backup before rollback for safety

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Hugo build failure
- Test failures
- Handbook compliance violations
- Performance regression (>60s build time)
- Security vulnerabilities

### 3. Four-Eyes Enforcer (`/.claude/validation/four-eyes-enforcer.sh`)

**Purpose**: Mandatory dual validation per handbook requirements

**Functionality**:
- Automatic agent pairing based on task type
- Consensus validation between agents
- Pairing health monitoring
- Emergency override with audit trail
- Cross-agent coordination via memory

**Pairing Matrix**:
- Content creation: content-specialist + seo-expert
- Code changes: coder + reviewer
- Bug fixes: coder + tester
- Security changes: developer + security-expert
- Architecture changes: architect + architecture-expert

### 4. Verification Guardian Agent (`/.claude/agents/verification-guardian.json`)

**Purpose**: Orchestrate and enforce all verification mechanisms

**Responsibilities**:
- Coordinate validation hooks
- Manage quality gates
- Track compliance metrics
- Handle emergency situations
- Maintain audit logs

## Integration Points

### Git Integration

```bash
# Pre-commit hook installed at:
.git/hooks/pre-commit

# Automatically runs validation before every commit
```

### Claude Settings Integration

```json
{
  "verification_hooks": {
    "pre_commit": ".claude/hooks/pre-commit-validation.sh",
    "rollback": ".claude/hooks/rollback-mechanism.sh",
    "four_eyes": ".claude/validation/four-eyes-enforcer.sh"
  }
}
```

### Agent Coordination

All agents must:
1. Check with Verification Guardian before operations
2. Participate in Four-Eyes pairing when required
3. Record validations for consensus
4. Respect rollback decisions

## Usage Instructions

### Normal Workflow

1. **Initialize Pairing** (automatic on task start):
   ```bash
   .claude/validation/four-eyes-enforcer.sh init
   ```

2. **Perform Work** with paired agents

3. **Record Validations**:
   ```bash
   .claude/validation/four-eyes-enforcer.sh validate coder approve
   .claude/validation/four-eyes-enforcer.sh validate reviewer approve
   ```

4. **Commit Changes** (validation runs automatically):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your message"
   ```

### Rollback Procedures

**Interactive Rollback**:
```bash
.claude/hooks/rollback-mechanism.sh
# Select checkpoint from list
```

**Automatic Rollback** (on failure):
```bash
.claude/hooks/rollback-mechanism.sh --auto "Reason for rollback"
```

**Emergency Rollback**:
```bash
.claude/hooks/rollback-mechanism.sh --emergency
```

### Emergency Override

For critical situations only:
```bash
.claude/validation/four-eyes-enforcer.sh override "Emergency reason"
# Type: OVERRIDE-FOUR-EYES to confirm
```

⚠️ **WARNING**: All overrides are audited and reviewed

## Compliance Mapping

### Global Handbook References

| Requirement | Global Handbook | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Four-Eyes Principle | `/knowledge/20.02-four-eyes-principle-global.md` | `four-eyes-enforcer.sh` |
| TDD Methodology | `/knowledge/20.01-tdd-methodology-reference.md` | `pre-commit-validation.sh` |
| Zero-Defect Philosophy | `/knowledge/20.03-zero-defect-philosophy.md` | Quality gates in validation |
| Security-First | `/knowledge/40.01-security-first-development.md` | Security checks in hooks |
| Agent Coordination | `/knowledge/30.01-agent-coordination-patterns.md` | Agent pairing system |

### Quality Gates

| Gate | Threshold | Action on Failure |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Hugo Build | Must succeed | Block commit |
| Hugo Debug Build | Must succeed with clean diagnostics | Block commit |
| Template Performance | No critical performance warnings | Warning |
| Memory Usage | Within acceptable limits | Warning |
| Cache Issues | No cache-related problems detected | Block commit |
| Test Coverage | >80% | Warning |
| Build Time | <30 seconds | Warning |
| Image Size | <500KB | Warning |
| Markdown Lint | No errors | Block on errors |
| Four-Eyes | Consensus required | Block commit |

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Tracked Metrics

- Validation success rate
- Rollback frequency
- Compliance violations
- Agent pairing effectiveness
- Quality gate performance

### Alert Thresholds

- Validation failure rate: >10% triggers alert
- Rollbacks per day: >2 triggers review
- Compliance violations: Any violation triggers immediate review

### Audit Logs

All verification activities logged to:
- `.claude/logs/rollback.log` - Rollback operations
- `.claude/validation/audit.log` - Compliance audits
- `.claude/validation/emergency-overrides.log` - Override usage

## Maintenance

### Daily Tasks

1. Review validation metrics
2. Check for stale pairing sessions
3. Monitor rollback frequency

### Weekly Tasks

1. Audit emergency overrides
2. Clean old checkpoints (automatic, keeps last 10)
3. Review compliance violations

### Monthly Tasks

1. Update pairing matrix based on patterns
2. Tune quality gate thresholds
3. Review and update handbook references

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "No active pairing session found"
**Solution**: Run `.claude/validation/four-eyes-enforcer.sh init`

**Issue**: "Hugo build failed after rollback"
**Solution**: Use emergency rollback or restore from git

**Issue**: "Checkpoint file corrupted"
**Solution**: Use older checkpoint or git restoration

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Failed Validation**: Fix issues and retry
2. **Failed Rollback**: Use emergency rollback
3. **Corrupted State**: Clear all sessions and reinitialize
4. **Lost Checkpoints**: Restore from git history

## Success Metrics

The verification system is considered successful when:

- ✅ Zero broken commits reach main branch
- ✅ 100% Four-Eyes compliance on qualifying changes
- ✅ <2 rollbacks per week
- ✅ >95% validation success rate
- ✅ Zero unaudited emergency overrides

## Conclusion

This verification system provides comprehensive protection against broken changes while maintaining development velocity through intelligent automation and clear escape hatches for emergencies. The system strictly enforces handbook compliance while providing the flexibility needed for real-world development scenarios.
