# JetThoughts Content Writing Style Guide
*Based on proven technical content writing best practices*

## Core voice and personality

### Who we are when we write
- **A friendly professional**: Knowledgeable but approachable, never condescending
- **An eager teacher**: Genuinely excited to share knowledge and help others learn
- **A continuous learner**: Open to new ideas, acknowledging when we don't know something
- **A trusted advisor**: Balancing expertise with empathy and understanding

### How we sound
- **Conversational but professional**: Like talking to a knowledgeable colleague over coffee
- **Personal but not overly casual**: Professional without being stiff
- **Direct and helpful**: Use "you" frequently, make it personal
- **Excited about technology**: Let our nerdy enthusiasm show appropriately

## Writing mechanics

### Sentence structure
- **Favor short, clear sentences**: Even if occasionally grammatically imperfect
- **Use contractions liberally**: "it's", "you're", "we'll", "don't" - sounds more conversational
- **Break up complex ideas**: Multiple short sentences over one long, complex one
- **Vary sentence length**: Mix short punchy statements with longer explanatory ones

### Formatting standards
- **Sentence case for headings**: "How to write better code" not "How To Write Better Code"
- **Numbers over words**: Use "3" instead of "three", "10" instead of "ten"
- **Oxford comma always**: "design, development, and growth"
- **One exclamation point rule**: Maximum one per paragraph, use wisely

### Word choice simplifications
Replace formal language with accessible alternatives:
- "utilize" → "use"
- "implement" → "build" or "create"
- "facilitate" → "help"
- "furthermore" → "also"
- "subsequently" → "then"
- "the user" → "you"
- "it is recommended" → "we recommend"

## Content organization

### Blog post structure
1. **Problem-first opening**: Start with a relatable problem or question
2. **Context setting**: Brief explanation of why this matters
3. **Progressive complexity**: Build from simple to complex examples
4. **Practical application**: Always tie back to real-world usage
5. **Clear takeaways**: What readers should do next

### Educational approach
- **Start with the big picture**: Why does this matter?
- **Use analogies and metaphors**: Make abstract concepts concrete
- **Code examples are non-negotiable**: Every technical concept needs a working example
- **Explain every example**: Don't just show code, explain what it does and why
- **Address edge cases**: Don't pretend everything works perfectly all the time

### Engagement techniques
- **Ask rhetorical questions**: "Have you ever wondered...?" "What if we could...?"
- **Share personal experiences**: "We recently ran into this problem..."
- **Anticipate concerns**: "You might be thinking..."
- **Acknowledge different perspectives**: "Some people prefer..."
- **Include gentle humor**: Technical puns in titles, playful analogies

## Hugo-specific implementation

### Using markdown alternatives for content structure
```markdown
## Database queries running slow?
Let's optimize them together.

### Optimizing a slow query
```ruby
# Your code here
```

> **Tip**: Remember: Always measure before optimizing!

## Conclusion
Consider next steps and explore related posts for deeper learning.
```

### Style validation approach
Content should be manually reviewed against this style guide to ensure compliance with JetThoughts writing principles. Focus on voice, tone, and readability rather than automated validation.

## Quality checklist

Before publishing any content:
- [ ] **Clarity test**: Can someone unfamiliar with the topic follow along?
- [ ] **Code verification**: Do all examples actually work?
- [ ] **Tone consistency**: Does it sound friendly and professional throughout?
- [ ] **Value proposition**: Is the benefit to readers clear?
- [ ] **Conversational elements**: Are we using contractions and "you" address?
- [ ] **Sentence case**: Are all headings in sentence case?
- [ ] **Practical focus**: Can readers apply this immediately?

## Examples

### Good example (JetThoughts style):
> "Have you ever wondered why your Rails app slows down over time? We've been there too. Let's explore three simple techniques that'll help you identify and fix performance bottlenecks."

### Avoid (overly formal):
> "This document provides comprehensive coverage of Ruby on Rails performance optimization techniques for enterprise development environments."

## Implementation timeline

### Phase 1: High-impact technical posts (Weeks 1-2)
- Ruby/Rails performance optimization posts
- Technical tutorials and how-tos
- Development best practices content

### Phase 2: Client-focused content (Weeks 3-4)
- Service pages
- Case studies
- Project showcases

### Phase 3: Recent posts and documentation (Weeks 5-6)
- Blog posts from last 6 months
- Technical documentation
- Team and about pages

### Phase 4: Templates and automation (Weeks 7-8)
- Content templates
- Style validation CI/CD integration
- Team training and documentation

- **Hugo implementation**: Standard markdown with Hugo shortcodes and partials

## Final notes

Remember: We're knowledgeable friends who genuinely want to help our readers succeed. Every post should leave readers feeling more capable and confident than when they started.

The goal isn't just to inform, but to empower readers to solve their own problems and grow in their technical abilities.
