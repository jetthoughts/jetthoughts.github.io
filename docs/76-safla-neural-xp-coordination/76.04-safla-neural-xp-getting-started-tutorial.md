```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Users/pftg/dev/jetthoughts.github.io

# 1. Verify memory infrastructure
echo "Checking memory namespaces..."
npx claude-flow@alpha memory search --pattern "safla-xp/*/_initialized" | wc -l
# Expected: 20+ namespaces

# 2. Verify agent deployment
echo "Checking SAFLA agents..."
npx claude-flow@alpha agent list | grep "safla"
# Expected: 4 agents listed (xp-coordinator, tdd-coordinator, pair-facilitator, reflection-protocol)

# 3. Verify monitoring active
echo "Checking practice monitoring..."
npx claude-flow@alpha monitoring status | grep "XP Practice Monitoring"
# Expected: "ACTIVE"

# 4. Verify feedback loop scheduled
echo "Checking learning automation..."
npx claude-flow@alpha workflow list | grep "SAFLA Feedback Loop"
# Expected: "SCHEDULED"
```

**If any checks fail**: Return to `76.02-safla-neural-xp-implementation-how-to.md` Phase 1-3.

**All checks pass?** Continue to Exercise 1!

## üìö Exercise 1: Monitored Pair Programming Session (20 minutes)

### Objective

Experience SAFLA monitoring a live pair programming session and capturing effectiveness data.

### Scenario

You and a partner will work on a real jt_site task using pair programming. SAFLA will monitor your session automatically.

### Instructions

#### Step 1.1: Start Monitored Session

```bash
# Spawn XP Coordinator (activates monitoring)
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type "xp-coordinator-safla"

# Spawn Pair Facilitator (manages rotation)
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type "pair-facilitator-safla"

# Verify agents active
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm status
# Expected: Both agents listed as ACTIVE
```

**What just happened?**
- XP Coordinator activated practice monitoring
- Pair Facilitator will manage rotation timing
- Monitoring begins capturing session data automatically

#### Step 1.2: Execute Pair Programming Task

**Task**: Consolidate CSS duplications (real jt_site work)

**Pairing Instructions**:
1. **Decide roles**: Who starts as Driver, who as Navigator?
2. **Driver**: Execute the task (modify CSS files)
3. **Navigator**: Provide guidance, spot issues, think ahead
4. **Natural collaboration**: Work as you normally would

**Sample Task** (feel free to choose your own):
```bash
# Task: Consolidate fl-grid-layout.css duplications
# Goal: Remove duplicate CSS rules, test after each change

# Driver starts (Navigator guides)
# Work naturally for 15-20 minutes
```

**IMPORTANT**: Work naturally! SAFLA learns from authentic practice, not artificial "perfect" execution.

#### Step 1.3: Experience SAFLA Coordination

**After ~15 minutes**, the Pair Facilitator may intervene:

```
üîî Pair Facilitator (SAFLA): "Natural rotation point detected.
   Consider rotating roles now for optimal collaboration."
```

**Your Response**:
- If it feels natural: Rotate roles and continue
- If you're in the middle of something: Continue and rotate when ready

**What's happening?**
- Pair Facilitator monitoring engagement signals
- System detecting natural breakpoints
- Learning what timing works for your team

#### Step 1.4: Complete Session

**When task completed**:

```bash
# Mark session complete
echo "üìù Session complete, capturing effectiveness data..."

# Check session data captured
npx claude-flow@alpha memory search \
  --pattern "safla-xp/episodes/pair-programming" \
  --sort "timestamp DESC" \
  --limit 1

# Expected: JSON object with complete session data
```

**Review Captured Data**:

```json
{
  "session_id": "pair-session-20251001-143022",
  "practice_type": "pair-programming",
  "participants": {
    "driver": "you",
    "navigator": "partner",
    "skill_levels": {"driver": "intermediate", "navigator": "expert"}
  },
  "timeline": [
    {"event": "session_start", "timestamp": "2025-10-01T14:30:22Z"},
    {"event": "rotation", "timestamp": "2025-10-01T14:45:18Z"},
    {"event": "session_end", "timestamp": "2025-10-01T14:58:42Z"}
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "duration_minutes": 28,
    "rotations_count": 1,
    "productivity": 0.82,
    "collaboration_quality": 0.88
  }
}
```

**Reflection Questions** (discuss with partner):
1. Did the rotation timing feel appropriate?
2. Was Navigator engagement high throughout?
3. Did you accomplish the task effectively?
4. What would you change about the pairing?

**Your answers will help SAFLA learn!** (Satisfaction survey at end of tutorial)

## üß™ Exercise 2: Monitored TDD Cycle (20 minutes)

### Objective

Experience SAFLA monitoring a complete RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle with strategy guidance.

### Scenario

You'll implement a new feature using TDD while SAFLA monitors phase execution and recommends strategies.

### Instructions

#### Step 2.1: Start TDD Cycle Monitoring

```bash
# Spawn TDD Coordinator (activates TDD monitoring)
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type "tdd-coordinator-safla"

# Verify agent active
npx claude-flow@alpha agent list | grep "tdd-coordinator-safla"
# Expected: ACTIVE
```

#### Step 2.2: RED Phase - Write Failing Test

**Task**: Add RSS feed validation to jt_site

**Context Analysis** (TDD Coordinator evaluates):
```
Task: RSS feed validation
Uncertainty: Moderate (RSS spec clear, but edge cases uncertain)
Complexity: Moderate (parsing XML, handling malformed input)
Time Pressure: Low (not urgent)

TDD Coordinator Recommendation:
üí° "Fake It strategy recommended for initial implementation.
   Start with constant return for valid feed, prepare for triangulation."
```

**Your Task**: Write failing test

```ruby
# test/unit/rss_feed_validator_test.rb
require 'test_helper'

class RssFeedValidatorTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  def test_validates_well_formed_rss_feed
    validator = RssFeedValidator.new
    valid_rss = '<rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Test</title></channel></rss>'

    result = validator.valid?(valid_rss)

    assert result, "Should accept well-formed RSS feed"
  end
end
```

**Run test**:

```bash
bin/rake test:unit TEST=test/unit/rss_feed_validator_test.rb
# Expected: FAIL (class doesn't exist yet)
```

**What SAFLA Captured**:
```json
{
  "phase": "RED",
  "test_granularity": "single_behavior",
  "test_type": "behavioral_validation",
  "failure_message": "uninitialized constant RssFeedValidator"
}
```

#### Step 2.3: GREEN Phase - Shameless Green Implementation

**TDD Coordinator Guidance**:
```
üü¢ GREEN Phase: Apply Fake It strategy

Guidance:
- Return constant `true` for now (passes test)
- Accept hardcoding without guilt
- Don't generalize yet (wait for second example)
```

**Your Task**: Implement minimal solution

```ruby
# lib/rss_feed_validator.rb
class RssFeedValidator
  def valid?(rss_content)
    # Fake It: Return constant that passes test
    true
  end
end
```

**Run test**:

```bash
bin/rake test:unit TEST=test/unit/rss_feed_validator_test.rb
# Expected: PASS (1 test, 0 failures)
```

**What SAFLA Captured**:
```json
{
  "phase": "GREEN",
  "strategy_used": "Fake It",
  "implementation_lines": 3,
  "time_to_green": "2 minutes 15 seconds",
  "tests_passing": 1
}
```

#### Step 2.4: Triangulation (Second Example)

**Add second test** (forces generalization):

```ruby
def test_rejects_malformed_rss_feed
  validator = RssFeedValidator.new
  invalid_rss = '<rss><invalid></rss>'

  result = validator.valid?(invalid_rss)

  assert_not result, "Should reject malformed RSS feed"
end
```

**Run tests**:

```bash
bin/rake test:unit TEST=test/unit/rss_feed_validator_test.rb
# Expected: FAIL (both tests passing, need real validation)
```

**Implement real validation**:

```ruby
class RssFeedValidator
  def valid?(rss_content)
    # Now generalize: Actually parse RSS
    doc = Nokogiri::XML(rss_content)
    doc.errors.empty? && doc.at_xpath('//rss[@version]')
  end
end
```

**Run tests**:

```bash
bin/rake test:unit TEST=test/unit/rss_feed_validator_test.rb
# Expected: PASS (2 tests, 0 failures)
```

**What SAFLA Captured**:
```json
{
  "triangulation_triggered": true,
  "generalization_forced_by": "second_example",
  "final_implementation_approach": "real_validation",
  "cycle_complete": true
}
```

#### Step 2.5: REFACTOR Phase (Optional)

**TDD Coordinator Guidance**:
```
üîµ REFACTOR Phase: Apply flocking rules if duplication exists

Current analysis:
- No duplication detected (single use)
- Code clear and simple
- Tests green

Recommendation: ‚úÖ REFACTOR not needed, cycle complete
```

**Reflection Questions**:
1. Did Fake It strategy feel appropriate?
2. Did triangulation force useful generalization?
3. How long did the complete cycle take?
4. Would you approach it differently next time?

## üîÑ Exercise 3: Trigger Learning Cycle (10 minutes)

### Objective

Manually trigger the feedback loop to see pattern extraction in action.

### Instructions

#### Step 3.1: Review Captured Episodes

**View pair programming episode**:

```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha memory search \
  --pattern "safla-xp/episodes/pair-programming" \
  --sort "timestamp DESC" \
  --limit 1
```

**View TDD cycle episode**:

```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha memory search \
  --pattern "safla-xp/episodes/tdd-cycle" \
  --sort "timestamp DESC" \
  --limit 1
```

**What you see**: Complete JSON records of your practice sessions with all context and outcomes.

#### Step 3.2: Manually Trigger Feedback Loop

**Normally runs nightly at 2 AM, but we'll trigger manually for tutorial**:

```bash
# Execute feedback loop workflow
echo "üîÑ Starting SAFLA Feedback Loop (manual trigger)..."
npx claude-flow@alpha workflow execute --name "SAFLA Feedback Loop Automation"

# Monitor execution
npx claude-flow@alpha workflow status --name "SAFLA Feedback Loop Automation"
# Expected: Shows stage progression (Outcome Observation ‚Üí Pattern Extraction ‚Üí Learning Integration)
```

**Expected Output**:

```
üîÑ SAFLA Feedback Loop Automation - Execution Log

[Stage 1: Outcome Observation]
‚úÖ Retrieved 2 episodes (1 pair-programming, 1 tdd-cycle)
‚úÖ Calculated effectiveness scores
   - Pair programming: 0.85 effectiveness
   - TDD cycle: 0.88 effectiveness
‚úÖ Stored outcomes to episodic memory

[Stage 2: Pattern Extraction]
‚ö†Ô∏è  Insufficient sample size for pattern validation
    (n=2, need n>=10 for statistical significance)
‚úÖ Episodes stored for future pattern extraction
‚úÖ Baseline effectiveness established

[Stage 3: Learning Integration]
‚ÑπÔ∏è  No patterns validated yet (waiting for more data)
‚úÖ Baseline patterns remain active

[Stage 4: Strategy Adaptation]
‚úÖ Using seeded baseline patterns for coordination
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Personalized patterns will emerge after 10+ sessions
```

**What happened?**
1. ‚úÖ System retrieved your practice episodes
2. ‚úÖ Calculated effectiveness from outcomes
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Not enough data yet to validate new patterns (need 10+ sessions)
4. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Baseline seeded patterns still in use
5. ‚úÖ Your data stored for future learning

**This is normal!** Pattern learning requires multiple sessions. Let's see progress so far.

#### Step 3.3: Review Learning Progress

**Check episode count**:

```bash
# How many sessions captured total?
npx claude-flow@alpha memory search --pattern "safla-xp/episodes/*" | wc -l
# Expected: 2 (your tutorial sessions)

# Need 10+ for pattern validation, you've contributed 2!
echo "Progress: 2/10 sessions captured (20% toward first pattern learning)"
```

**Check baseline patterns in use**:

```bash
# View active patterns
npx claude-flow@alpha memory search --pattern "safla-xp/patterns/*/optimal"

# Expected: 5 seeded baseline patterns
# (Will grow as your team's learned patterns are validated)
```

## üìä Exercise 4: Interpret Effectiveness Metrics (5 minutes)

### Objective

Understand how SAFLA measures practice effectiveness.

### Instructions

#### Step 4.1: Review Your Session Metrics

**Pair programming effectiveness breakdown**:

```json
{
  "effectiveness_scores": {
    "productivity": 0.82,  // Task completion speed
    "quality": 0.85,       // Code quality metrics
    "collaboration": 0.88, // Engagement signals
    "overall": 0.85        // Weighted average
  },
  "contributing_factors": {
    "positive": [
      "Strong Navigator engagement throughout",
      "Natural rotation timing",
      "Clear communication patterns"
    ],
    "improvement_areas": [
      "Could increase rotation frequency for complex sections",
      "Driver struggled briefly (15:42-15:46) before Navigator intervention"
    ]
  }
}
```

**TDD cycle effectiveness breakdown**:

```json
{
  "effectiveness_scores": {
    "test_quality": 0.92,      // Behavioral focus, clear assertions
    "cycle_timing": 0.85,      // Reasonable RED-GREEN duration
    "strategy_fit": 0.88,      // Fake It appropriate for context
    "overall": 0.88
  },
  "contributing_factors": {
    "positive": [
      "Clear test first approach (RED before GREEN)",
      "Fake It strategy well-matched to uncertainty level",
      "Triangulation forced useful generalization"
    ],
    "improvement_areas": [
      "Could write finer-grained tests (multiple behaviors detected)",
      "REFACTOR phase skipped (no duplication, so appropriate)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Key Insight**: Effectiveness is **multidimensional**. SAFLA tracks multiple factors to get holistic view.

#### Step 4.2: Compare to Baseline

**Your sessions vs seeded baselines**:

```yaml
pair_programming:
  your_effectiveness: 0.85
  baseline_effectiveness: 0.85 (seeded from handbook)
  delta: 0.00 (matching baseline, good!)

tdd_cycle:
  your_effectiveness: 0.88
  baseline_effectiveness: 0.88 (seeded from handbook)
  delta: 0.00 (matching baseline, good!)
```

**What this means**:
- ‚úÖ You're executing practices at expected effectiveness levels
- ‚úÖ System establishing **your team's** baseline (will personalize from here)
- ‚è≥ After 10+ sessions, learned patterns will outperform generic baselines

---

## üéì Exercise 5: Satisfaction Feedback (5 minutes)

### Objective

Provide satisfaction feedback to help SAFLA learn subjective effectiveness dimensions.

### Instructions

#### Step 5.1: Complete Satisfaction Survey

**Pair Programming Session**:

```yaml
session_id: "pair-session-20251001-143022"

rating_scale: "1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)"

  overall_effectiveness:
    question: "How effective was this pairing session?"
    your_rating: ___/5

  rotation_timing:
    question: "Was rotation timing appropriate?"
    your_rating: ___/5
    comments: "___"

  collaboration_quality:
    question: "How well did you collaborate?"
    your_rating: ___/5

  would_repeat:
    question: "Would you pair this way again?"
    your_rating: ___/5

open_feedback: "What would improve future pairing sessions? ___"
```

**TDD Cycle**:

```yaml
session_id: "tdd-cycle-20251001-145830"

  test_quality:
    question: "Are you confident in test quality?"
    your_rating: ___/5

  learning_value:
    question: "Did you learn something valuable?"
    your_rating: ___/5

open_feedback: "What would improve future TDD cycles? ___"
```

#### Step 5.2: Submit Feedback

```bash
# Submit satisfaction feedback
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store \
  --namespace "safla-xp/surveys/satisfaction" \
  --key "survey-pair-$(date +%s)" \
  --value "$(cat your-pair-survey.json)" \
  --ttl 2592000

npx claude-flow@alpha memory store \
  --namespace "safla-xp/surveys/satisfaction" \
  --key "survey-tdd-$(date +%s)" \
  --value "$(cat your-tdd-survey.json)" \
  --ttl 2592000

echo "‚úÖ Satisfaction feedback submitted, SAFLA will incorporate into learning"
```

**What happens next?**
- Your ratings influence effectiveness calculations
- Open feedback helps identify improvement opportunities
- System learns to optimize for **your team's** satisfaction patterns

1. **Continue practicing** (8 more sessions needed for first pattern learning):
   - Pair program naturally, SAFLA monitors automatically
   - Follow TDD cycles, let system capture data
   - Complete satisfaction surveys after each session

2. **Monitor progress**:
   ```bash
   # Check episode count weekly
   npx claude-flow@alpha memory search --pattern "safla-xp/episodes/*" | wc -l

   # When count reaches 10, check for validated patterns
   npx claude-flow@alpha memory search --pattern "safla-xp/patterns/*/optimal"
   ```

3. **Review learning dashboard**:
   - Access dashboard (URL provided during deployment)
   - Watch "Pattern Recognition Speed" metric
   - Notice when first pattern reaches validation threshold

4. **Prepare for next tutorial**: "Advanced Pattern Interpretation" (coming when first pattern learned)
