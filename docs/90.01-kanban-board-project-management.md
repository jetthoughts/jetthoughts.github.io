## 🤖 Agent Integration Instructions

### For Discovery & Opportunity Identification
When agents identify improvement opportunities during regular work:

1. **Create Job Story**: Format the opportunity as a job story
2. **Add to Backlog**: Place in appropriate category with labels
3. **Link Context**: Reference source files, analysis, or discussions
4. **Estimate Effort**: Provide rough effort estimate (hours/days/weeks)
5. **Suggest Swarm**: Recommend appropriate agent combination

### For Task Execution
When working on tasks from the board:

1. **Update Status**: Move task to "In Progress" with agent assignment
2. **Use TodoWrite**: Create detailed todo tracking for complex tasks
3. **Link Dependencies**: Reference related tasks or blockers
4. **Update Progress**: Regular status updates in task description
5. **Quality Gates**: Follow Four-Eyes Principle for all changes

### For Task Completion
When completing tasks:

1. **Validate Acceptance Criteria**: Ensure job story outcome achieved
2. **Document Deliverables**: Link to created/modified files
3. **Update Metrics**: Record completion time and any learnings
4. **Move to Review**: Request appropriate swarm review
