## Architecture Standards

All architecture documentation follows ADR template standards:
- Clear problem statement and context
- Considered options and trade-offs
- Decision rationale and consequences
- Status tracking (proposed, accepted, deprecated)

## Usage

When making architectural decisions, create new ADR documents following the established template format. Design patterns should be documented with implementation examples and usage guidelines.
