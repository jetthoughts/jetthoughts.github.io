### Crafting The Perfect Resume

Okay, so your resume? It's your first impression. Make it count. Don't just list your jobs. Show what you did. Use action words. Quantify your achievements. Did you improve something? By how much? Numbers grab attention. Tailor your resume to each job. A generic resume is a no-go. Make sure it's easy to read. No one wants to hunt for info. Keep it concise. Two pages max, unless you're a super senior. Proofread. Then proofread again. Typos are a killer. Use a [resume template](https://www.builtinsf.com/jobs) to make sure it looks professional.

### Tips For Writing A Standout Cover Letter

Think of your cover letter as your sales pitch. It's where you show your personality. Don't just repeat your resume. Explain why you want _this_ job at _this_ company. Show you've done your homework. Mention something specific about the company that excites you. Keep it short and sweet. One page is plenty. Start with a strong opening. Grab their attention. End with a call to action. Make it easy for them to contact you. Proofread. Seriously, proofread. A good cover letter can make all the difference. **It shows you care.**

### Networking Like A Pro

Networking isn't just about collecting contacts. It's about building relationships. Attend PHP meetups. Go to conferences. Join online communities. Be active. Share your knowledge. Ask questions. Offer help. Don't just ask for jobs. Give first. LinkedIn is your friend. Update your profile. Connect with people in your field. Engage with their content. Send personalized messages. Don't be a stranger. Follow up with people you meet. A simple "nice to meet you" can go a long way. Networking is a long game. Be patient. Be persistent. Be genuine.

> Networking is about building genuine connections. It's not just about what you can get, but what you can give. Focus on helping others, and opportunities will naturally arise.
